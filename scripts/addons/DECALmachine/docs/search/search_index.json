DECAlmachine 2.0 - introducing new export capabilities with Atlasing and deep Trim Sheet support cover image: Strikebreaker - designed and built by Alexander Lortkipanidze - Artstation , Twitter DECALmachine is a blender addon , which through mesh Decals , allows for surface detailing in a very non-committal, non-destructive, UV-less way. As such it represents an alternative approach to hard surface texturing. In addition DECALmachine has deep Trim Sheet support, and supports Atlasing , as well as Baking to facilitate exporting to game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine etc. Decals can be projected , sliced , created from grease pencil or edges . They can be material matched , and you can easily create your own . Trims can be easily placed , cut , manipulated or removed - all directly in the 3D view. Read on below for an overview of DECALmachine's tools and concepts. Keep in mind The focus of DECALmachine is speed and flexibility in terms of Design and Detailing. Depending on how far you intend to take your designs, and especially if you, intend to use complex shader node setups or do complex texturing such as weathering , floating mesh decals might not be the best workflow, unless you are targeting a deferred rendering solution with mesh decal support, which allows for selective channel blending, instead of just alpha blending as in Blender's Eeevee and Cycles.

Instead you can just place your details, re-arrange them at any time, project them on curved surfaces or explore paneling , graphics, logos etc. DECALmachine's Decal tool set is in essence object-based, UV-less texturing . Learn more about what a decal actually is and how it works. This hard surface detailing workflow is incredibly fast and versatile, very easy to handle and manipulate, without committing to any decisions, making it a fantastic choice for 3d concept design workflows . DECALmachine can be used on its own, or to complement other hard surface workflows, such as a bevel and boolean based approach used by HardOps and BoxCutter or the classic subdivision surface approach. It all works, it will even work on models exported from Solids/NURBS/CAD based tools such as MoI3D or Fusion 360! The beauty of decals is, your results are not limited by texture sizes - details remain sharp, even when seen from up-close, which can be especially important for game artists . Game artists also require a way to get Decals out of Blender and into Unity, Unreal Engine etc, and DECALmachine offers 3 approaches to do so. These export approaches are Atlasing , Trim Sheets and Baking . While a Decal Atlas would be used in a deferred render pipeline with Decal shaders, Trim Sheets and Baking can be used in forward rendering too. Of the last two, Trim Sheets stand out, because they offer almost all the same benefits Decals offer, especially in terms of visual quality (over baked decals or textures in general). To work effortlesly with Trim Sheets, DECALmachine offers a suite of Trim UV tools , that can be used directly from the 3D view. In addition to the various tools to simplify and automate working with mesh Decals and Trim Sheets , DECALmachine also supplies 109 Decals, 1 Trim Sheet with its 64 Trim Decals, and 2 Atlases - ready to be used. You are of course in no way limited by what DECALmachine provides. You can create your own Decals and Trim Sheets directly in Blender . The documentation also hosts a list of 3rd party Decal packs .

But unlike actual texturing, detailing using Decals, does not require any UVs being present and is extremely flexible, due to it being noncommittal, non-destructive and object based. Note This is not to be confused with mixing textures and materials via multiple uv channels on the same objects, for which term Decal is also sometimes used. Libraries Each individual Decal is stored in a folder containing a decal.blend file, a decal.png thumbnail and the Decal Textures . Decal folders themselves are then stored in Decal Libraries . There is no limit to the number of Decal Libraries you can have, and there are ways to organized them in the addon preferences . Decal Libraries are located in $assets/Decals where $assets is the chosen DECALmachine assets path . DECALmachine supplies three Decal Libraries of its own to get you started. Trim Sheet Librares - or Trim Decal Libraries - are similar, but they also provide an entire Texture Sheet and a data.json file in addition to the individual Trim Decals . They are stored in $assets/Trims . Both Library types can be shared with other DECALmachine users as folders or zipped . Check out the Decal Resources , if you are looking for 3rd party Decal Libraries or Trim Sheet Libraries . Importing Libraries is then also explained in the addon preferences . Also, check out this Export Introduction , that explains how Decal Libraries , Atlases and Trim Sheets are related. Clipping If a Decal is too close to an object's surface, you may see flickering, or in Cycles even blackness. * flickering in Eevee, blackness in Cycles* The solution is almost always to increase the Decal Height , which is done through a Displace modifier, that every Decal has. Sometimes this issue is also caused by the 3d view's Clip Start value, if it's too low. Parallax Simple, Subset and Panel Decals take advantage of Parallax , which is a shader effect, that by utilizing an UV offset, creates the illusion of depth on flat geometry. Keep in mind How well parallax works depends on the angle you are looking at it from. Also, parallax works better for some types of detail than others. Going into the surface, works surprisingly well. Going above, not so much. A single level of depth works better than multiple levels. Finally, it also works better on square compared to elongated Decals. Orthographic Views and Cameras The parallax effect will not work properly in an orthographic viewport. However, you can still render it perfectly, when using an orthographic camera. Mirror One huge advantage of mesh decals being objects - as opposed to just textures, or part of a texture - is that you can use modifiers on them. The Mirror modifier especially comes to mind. Arrays can also be useful at times. To setup the mirror modifier for decals, you need to tell it to mirror the UVs as well - in most cases that would be the Flip U option, in some rare ones it's Flip V , it depends on how the decal is layed out. Without the UVs being mirrored, the parallax effect will be distorted and text will be reversed and unreadable. In addition and with a Normal Transfer mod being present in the stack, make sure any mirror modifier is positioned before it. Normal Transfers should always be at the end. A great way to mirror decals and do all the above automatically, is by using the Mirror(and Un-Mirror) tools in MACHIN3tools , as demonstrated below. Trimsheets and Trim Decals Introduced in version 2 of DECALmachine, Trim Decals are in essence just like the regular Decals described above. So a Trim Decal can be a Simple, Subset, Panel or Info decal, depending on its material. The only real difference is that Trim Decals are created from and so associated with and stored alongside a specific Trim Sheet . This enables them to be used with the Trim Cut tool, which does not work with regular Decals.

custom normals addon preferences place Get Support button at top of addon prefs add custom updater NOTE: since it's only introduced now in 2.11, it will only be of use for upcoming releases, so can't be used to install this very 2.11 update yet allows for very easy addon update installation from .zip file, and from inside of Blender, instead of manually from the file browser finds matching .zip file(s) in home and Downloads folder allows selecting one of them them or manually selecting a file in any other location extracts the file to a temporary location, and installs update when quitting Blender like a manual update installation from the filebrowser, this maintains previous addon settings and custom keys see installation instructions for details supports - and defaults to - keeping the current assets to prevent accidental loss handlers rework when and how handler logic is executed add asset drop cleanup handler (previously in MACHIN3tools) to automatically unlink decal backup

2.10 2024-01-22 deep refactor of decal and trimsheet asset registration and validation comprehensively analyze the entire assets location and sort and categorize everything UpdateDecalLibrary tool introduce universal update op, that deals with all versions 1.8 - 2.5 keep custom subset component inputs, that may have been stored in a library decal .blend file support fixing and/or updating ambiguous libraries (with multiple version files) support updating libraries, where each decal's version differs from the indicated library version (due to user-manipulated version file) deal with various potential update failure cases and support skipping individual decals if something goes wrong decal.blend, decal.png or any of the supplied textures are corrupt/0kb files any expected texture is missing decal object can't be found in the decal.blend decal material can't be found in the decal.blend decal object and decal material version mismatch decal version not set on decal object or decal material decal version and library version mismatch, due to user-manipulated version indicator file move skipped decals into dedicated Decals_Skipped or Trims_Skipped folders in the assets root directory and generate a log.txt file detailing why a specific decal was skipped automatically remove clutter (files or folders in locations were they shouldn't be) support updating empty libraries UpdateBlendFile tool in addition to the fading labels drawn in the viewport pointing out the presense of legacy decals in the blend file, now list them all in the update panel of the 3d view's sidebar also indicate whether these decals are actually registered, and so update-able to a new version remove ALT path-based fallback method support automatic re-setup of subset components in trim sheet

info box about skipped (at update attempt) decals, if present add Declutter tool, if any clutter is detected Quarantine tool simplify into a single op call, for removal of all qurantine-able assets no longer consider ambiguous libraries as quarantine-able, they can now be updated/fixed by the UpdateDecalLibrary tool or the Batch Updater recognize obsolete libraries as such, and quarantine them accordingly these are pre-1.8 libraries, that can't be user-updated anymore, they were seen as just corrupt previously generate log file for each quarantined library at the end pop a single message covering each quarantined librarry write quarantine log file into DECALmachine/logs folder declutter when changing the assets path explain and show how to get support directly in the addon prefs, when any issues are detected in the assets location hint: use the GetSupport tool, and get in touch via email GetSupport tool generate extensive \"health check\"-like output about assets location include

2023-12-16 introduce new asset versions for Blender 4 NOTE: in Blender 3.6 DM still uses the now legacy assets versioned 2.5 Blender 4.0 requires an user-initiated asset update to version 2.9, this is done from the addon preferences, after addon activation, using the Batch Updater add Update25DecalLibrary tool add Update25BlendFile tool the updated assets in Blender 4.0 - make use or new node panel feature on decal and trimsheet groups - use updated decal note tree for DECALmachine's new under/over coat feature draw 5 second fading warning labels when loading .blend files containing legacy

4.0 by default don't re-render asset thumbnails anymore hold ALT key (when clicking initially) to force re-rendering of decal thumbnails at the end clear all update library paths in the side bar panel Trim Sheet Creation add snapping support with 3 snapping types, when setting up trims custom snapping (# of divisions) pixel snap (sheet resolution) geometry (reference mesh) add Material Override feature based on suggestion and preliminary work by Justo Figueroa Thank you! override materials of selected objects and their decals optionally override decal subsets and emission too when overriding materials, an Override Node Tree is created, that determines the properties of the override material, that is used the override node tree's outputs are directly exposed from the Defaults section of the main DECALmachine sidebar panel in the 3D View, and can be tweaked without going to the shader editor there are white, grey and metal presets for quick access the DM created override node tree can be edited (make sure to set a fake user if you do, so your changes are remembered!) or any other user-created override node tree can be selected and used undo the override per-object, by running the tool with the ALT key pressed, or by toggling it in the redo panel or undo it globally simply by clearing the override node tree selector add ability to Under/Over Coat Decals (Blender 4 only!) decals sitting on Principled BSDF materials using a Coat, can be made to appear under or over said Coat meaning the decal normals either create an impression on the parent objects' coated surface, or they don't Over Coat it the default behavior fully support custom Material Overrides, with Coat Outputs Material Matching support matching new BSDF shader parameters in Blender 4.0 support matching Material Overrides support Under/Over Coating Decal Baking expose cage extrusion distance, based on work and tests by mem Thank you! this should help with and offer more control when dealing with \"baking through\" artifacts lower default and minimum ray distance to 0.0001 Decal Creation prevent characters such as ?,/ \\ in decal names leading to invalid file names Adjust Decal tool support (keep) material overrides when cycling through panel decals when finishing or canceling, remove unused panel decal materials, that were created while cycling support (keep) MACHIN3tools 1.7 unreleased at time of this release bevel shader setup when cycling panel decals ReApply tool avoid re-enabling normal transfers, if previously disabled by the user for panel decals, enforce Nearest Corner and Best Matching Face Normal loop mapping for panel decals instead of Nearest Face Interpolated this works well even for panel decals going across hard edges addon preferences change addon category to 3D View add option to not move assets when changing assets location redo how assets are moved when changing the assets path completely when changing the path to a location, that already has a decal lib of the same name as a library that is moved, move the old one to a separate collisions folder, that is not being registered by DM this will avoid overriding libraries, and so avoid creating libraries with mixed version files (called ambiguous decal libraries) when (re)loading libraries verify the complete assets path foldeer structure (create expected folders, if something is missing) force re-checking for legacy/collided/quarantined libraries for libraries that failed to register due to being ambiguous, corrupt or invalid allow moving them to _Quarantine locations accordingly this then removes the previous warning accordingly, and offers a way to investigate them in the file browser introduce registration_debug setting to control whether addon (un)registration confirmation is written to the terminal reshuffle layout slightly, moving asset loader settings to the left as well simplify and generalize how some of the various settings are drawn add CURVEmachine and HyperCursor unreleased at time of this release links to about section draw thank you for your support message directly above the addon preferences, instead of in a popup for 5 minutes, then disappear forever PIL

add version warning to prefs for Blender versions smaller than 2.93 add Transfer UVs tool (side panel tool) transfer decal parent's UVs to selected decals transfer image textures directly connected to decal parent's Principled BSDF node to selected decals' materials Decal Creation support info decal names from file name for info decals created from PNGs support skipping the automatic decal index, that's normally added to the front of the decal name this can then result in two kinds of conflicts without the index, an existing decal folder with the name of the to-be-added decal exist already when adding multiple decals the decal name could be a duplicate and so only the first of the duplicates will be added for both there are warnings in the creation panel and both cases will be skipped by the AddDecalToLibrary tool if any are skipped, there will be a popup message pointing it out support storing specific subset material component in the decal asset blend for Simple, Subset and Panel decals: skip normal flattening if enabled, but object is not smooth shaded ensure user is returned to original scene, when decal creation is finished Creation Panel add ability to open selected

This is necessary for efficient rendering in game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine etc. In DECALmachine this is a 2 step process: Atlas Creation Atlas Use and Export Note An Atlas in DECALmachine is defined by a set of textures, in combination with a data.json file, containing meta data about the specific position of each decal in the atlas. Atlases and Trim Sheets share the same data format, hence why atlased Decals are also referred to as Trims in the data file. Atlas Creation DECALmachine 2.0 provides 2 Atlases ready to go. One for the Aircraft Decal library, and one for the Example and Example Panels libraries. So, if you intend to export Decals from these libraries, you don't have to create your own Atlases, you can use the supplied ones. But if you want to export your own decals, you have to create your own Atlas too. Note You can pack Decals from a variety of Decal libraries into a single Atlas. You don't have to create per-library Atlases! Atlas Creation is done from the Decal, Atlas & Trim Sheet Creation panel . Use and Export Atlas Use Atlas In DECALmachine using an Atlas means, changing a Decal's UVs to match the position of that Decal in the Atlas. Individual Decals have UVs covering the entire UV space, but atlased Decals only cover a small part of it. With the UVs changed, all Decals belonging to the same Atlas, will then also share a single Atlas Material . This process of using an Atlas is reversible, so you can restore your original Decals using unique textures at any time. Note Since Trim Sheets use the same data format as Atlases, Trim Decals can use those Sheets as Atlases right away. There is no need to create new Atlases from Trim Decals, although you still can do that if you want. Join and Split atlased Decals For convenience DECALmachine also provides tools to Join and Split atlased Decals, because Decals that share a single Atlas Material, can be rendered more efficiently if they are a single object too. Export Atlas Exporting an Atlas simply refers to the process of copying Atlas Textures to the desired target location. If you want to channel pack the textures, you can do that directly from the Atlas section of the Decal Export Panel You can optionally export your atlased Decals and any other selected objects from that same panel, or just use Blender's native object export. Unity Unity comes with two main render pipelines : HDRP and URP. HDRP supports deferred rendering, while URP supports only forward rendering, and so no decal shaders. HDRP HDRP supplies it's own decal shader , that you can try. But most likely you'll you want to use a custom shader, for the Decals coming out of DECALmachine. Deferred Decals will effortlessly blend with any material that's under them, even textured ones With the advent of Shader Graph , creating your own Decal Shader is easy and everyone can do it. A Decal shader can be very simple, and for instance only affect normals, or it can be slightly more elaborate - but still pretty simple: a shader used for Simple/Subset/Panel Decals, affecting color, normals, AO, metalness, smoothness and emission a shader used for Info Decals, affecting, color, metalness, smoothness and emission You can download the two shaders above from this repo . Amplify Shader Editor You can also use ASE to build those exact same shaders. Not only does ASE provide a better experience, but you can also add parallax to you decals, that looks exactly like the one used by DECALmachine in Blender. Decal parallax in ASE using a white height map URP In URP's forward rendering, there's no way to reproduce the material blending you can have in HDRP. Decals will always be opaque, just like in Blender. And so if you use URP, I would suggest using Trim Sheets , over Decals. Note In theory, you could still use Decals in URP using a simple Lit Shader, optionally alpha mapped. But you'd be responsible for matching the Decal materials to the underlaying materials yourself. This is possible with simple, plain materials, but not feasible with textured ones. Unreal Engine This section about DECALmachine and Unreal Engine 4 is graciously provided by Thad Clevenger , who was intrumental in the release of DECALmachine 2.0 and provided feedback throughout development. Note I would kindly ask you to not contact Thad for support on this specifically and definitely not on DECALmachine in general. Instead, please submit any questions you may have and discuss this on Blender Artists or polycount . Background I am a Senior Artist at Funcom working on our next big project, and I was tasked with helping determine the pipeline for our vehicles/hard surface objects. After doing a lot of research we ended up deciding to use the mid-poly/decal workflow, that I\u2019m sure most of you are familiar with. This is where DECALmachine comes in. DECALmachine makes the process of creating, managing, and editing decals much easier. Needless to say, I wanted to add it into our pipeline. However, we were immediately faced with a big problem. UE4 does not have all of the functionality necessary to achieve the same visual results as DECALmachine in Blender or Unity . Thankfully, with some searching and help from one of our programmers (Marcos Pereira) we were able to add that functionality to UE4 and get close to 1 to 1 parity with DECALmachine in UE4. As of now, Unity is still more powerful than UE4 when it comes to decals, but if your project is using Unreal and you want a decal solution then this is the best I have found. 1. Patching Unreal Engine As I mentioned above, at the time of this tutorial version 4.24 UE4 still doesn\u2019t have all of the decal functionality that Unity does. Specifically, allowing you to edit the opacity channels of a decal independently. In order to get parity with DECALmachine, you MUST have the ability to edit the opacity of a decal independently in its Diffuse, Metallic, Roughness, and Normal channels. The good news is that you can fix this with a small code update. The fix for this is found here . You will need a Github account to access this link. I\u2019m not a programmer so I\u2019m going to assume that you will have one of your programmers look at this link and add the code where necessary. Hopefully Epic will update this themselves and then this step will no longer be necessary, but according to our programmers it is not hard to implement. What does the code change actually do? It allows you to create a new type of opacity map that is basically 3 masks in one. Depending on which channel the masks are in (R,G, or B) each channel affects a different part of your decal. A mask in the R channel of this map will ONLY affect the Diffuse and Emissive channels of your decal. A mask in the G channel of this map will ONLY affect the Normal channel of your decal. A mask in the B channel of this map will ONLY affect the Metal and Roughness channels of your decal. The bit of code below shows what I stated above. Out.MRT[0].a = Opacity.r; // Emissive Out.MRT[1].a = Opacity.g; // Normal Out.MRT[2].a = Opacity.b; // Metallic, Specular, Roughness Out.MRT[3].a = Opacity.r; // BaseColor Why is this functionality important? As you see in the image above, the decal is displaying ONLY its normal in certain areas (i.e. surrounding the bolt) but it displays all of its channels (diffuse, metallic, roughness and normal) on the bolt itself. Allowing only the normal of the decal to show up in certain areas gives a really nice \u201cbuilt in look\u201d. Because of this, this bolt will always look like part of the background no matter what material I use behind it. Combined with Parallax Occlusion this is almost indistinguishable from real geometry. Without the code change, a decal in UE4 shares transparency across all channels equally. This prevents you from being able to achieve these nice transitions from the background object to the decal. 2. DECALmachine Note This section just walks you though the atlasing and export process. It's also covered in more detail in video form above . Now that you\u2019ve implemented the code above you can author your decals. You can author them with any program, but I have found nothing that works better than DECALmachine and Blender out of the box. I\u2019m actually very new to Blender and still do most of my work in Maya. However, it is still worth it to bring my models into Blender just for DECALmachine alone. I can always bring them back into Maya when I\u2019m done and Blender is free so there is very little reason not to get it. I\u2019ve placed a few decals on this cube asset to represent a final model. Once you've finished your own asset in DECALmachine and are happy with how everything looks then it is time to create an atlas. This is a very powerful feature in DECALmachine so definitely take some time to go through the Atlasing section above. To create a new atlas from the decals you have placed you need to open up the DECALmachine sidebar in Blender by hitting the N hotkey. Then click on the MACHIN3 tab and go to the Decal, Atlas & Trim Sheet Creation section. Click Create new Decal Atlas from Scene , then re-pack/tweak as needed. Once you\u2019re happy, you need to Store selected Atlas . Next, Select your Atlas in in the export panel , and have your decals Use the Atlas . Now we can export the textures we need to set up everything in UE4. Your export panel should look something like this Make sure you have masks enabled in the Channel Packed section. The four drop down menus should be set to the following: Subset Occlusion Alpha Subset Occlusion None That is going to create our Opacity Mask that we talked about in Step 1 , which is the most important texture in getting this all to look correct in Unreal. Once your textures are exported, you will need to export your model as an fbx. Just select everything and export it as one object. 3. Finalizing Textures We are almost ready to set everything up in UE4. Before we do that however, I like to finish my textures in Substance Painter so that I can customize my atlas\u2019 materials. Also, UE4 does not currently v4.24 support AO for mesh decals, so I like to fake them in the texture. Normally this is a bad idea, but in this case it\u2019s the only option. I\u2019ll explain how in the next step. For this step I use Substance Painter, but you are free to do this however you like. In Painter it\u2019s easy to add wear and dirt to my decals, etc. To do this I bring the following maps, that I have just exported into Painter: Curvature AO Normal Subset Then I use these maps to generate my final atlas textures for UE4. I use the Subset texture as to mask where I want the materials of my decals to be - metal and paint in this instance. The vent in the bottom right is solely in the normal map so it doesn\u2019t receive any materials. Here is what the cube looks like in Painter when I\u2019m done. Note, there is no parallax here, just a normal. I added a metal material to the left decals and painted the top right decal yellow. I also added some grunge to everything. Faking AO Since UE4 doesn\u2019t have an AO channel for decals, make sure that ANY PART OF THE DECAL ONLY SHOWING THE NORMAL MAP is made black in the color map. Note DECALmachine itself, does not provide a color map for normal mapped Decals and so Atlases. This will really help make things look correct so I highly recommend doing it. It should look like the image below when done. use the inverted subset mask to apply black color If you do this correctly it will automatically work in UE4. This is due to how we exported the masks texture in Step 2 . It\u2019s complicated, but all you need to know is if your decal only has its normal map showing then it should be colored black for your diffuse / base color texture. At this point you can export your final textures from Painter. After that, you should have a Base Color, Packed Roughness/Metallic, and a Normal Map. Take these textures along with the Height map and Opacity map you exported from DECALmachine, and import them all into UE4. 4. Decal Shader in UE4 Now that we have the final atlas textures created, we need to set up the decal shader in UE4. And of course we are going to using mesh decals for this workflow, not decal actors . There are many reasons for this, but performance alone is worth it. The cons versus using a projected decal actor is, that you cannot move them around in engine. However, DECALmachine makes adjusting them easy and you just need to re-export the mesh again. First, create a material and call it whatever you like. This will be your decal material. In the materials Details tab change the material domain, blend mode, and decal blend mode, to the properties above. Now it\u2019s just a matter of plugging in all of the maps we\u2019ve created into their correct locations. Plug in your Base Color, Metallic, Roughness, and Normal to their corresponding channels. The only new part of this process is the masks texture we exported in Step 2 . Make sure you leave that texture set to sRGB in its properties and connect it to the Opacity channel as seen below. You can also see, that I have Parrallax Occlusion Mapping node connected to the UV inputs of my texture nodes, and I go into the settings for it below. Parallax Occlusion Mapping Plug the atlas height map at the top. I recommend you use the settings I have below for everything else. But feel free to play around with it or use a Bump Offset Node instead. Bump Offset doesn\u2019t look quite as good but is cheaper and still holds up for most cases. Conclusion Now that we have all of our maps plugged in correctly, it should look like the image below. You can use any material on the background cube object and the decals will look great due to the new opacity mask we generated. Here I swapped the cube\u2019s material to metal and the decals blend in perfectly due to the new opacity mask and code. This was a very rudimentary example, but the pros for using decals for micro details combined with mid-poly models can be great. No more texel density issues, lower texture memory, easy to edit, modular, faster to model, etc. I hope this helped you out. I know it's fairly technical, but it is intended for devs that are looking for a decal solution with UE4. Our goal is to help get UE4 working even better with DECALmachine in the future.

After doing a lot of research we ended up deciding to use the mid-poly/decal workflow, that I\u2019m sure most of you are familiar with. This is where DECALmachine comes in. DECALmachine makes the process of creating, managing, and editing decals much easier. Needless to say, I wanted to add it into our pipeline. However, we were immediately faced with a big problem. UE4 does not have all of the functionality necessary to achieve the same visual results as DECALmachine in Blender or Unity . Thankfully, with some searching and help from one of our programmers (Marcos Pereira) we were able to add that functionality to UE4 and get close to 1 to 1 parity with DECALmachine in UE4. As of now, Unity is still more powerful than UE4 when it comes to decals, but if your project is using Unreal and you want a decal solution then this is the best I have found.","title":"Background"},{"location":"export_atlas.html#1-patching-unreal-engine","text":"As I mentioned above, at the time of this tutorial version 4.24 UE4 still doesn\u2019t have all of the decal functionality that Unity does.

In order to get parity with DECALmachine, you MUST have the ability to edit the opacity of a decal independently in its Diffuse, Metallic, Roughness, and Normal channels. The good news is that you can fix this with a small code update. The fix for this is found here . You will need a Github account to access this link. I\u2019m not a programmer so I\u2019m going to assume that you will have one of your programmers look at this link and add the code where necessary.

Because of this, this bolt will always look like part of the background no matter what material I use behind it. Combined with Parallax Occlusion this is almost indistinguishable from real geometry. Without the code change, a decal in UE4 shares transparency across all channels equally. This prevents you from being able to achieve these nice transitions from the background object to the decal.","title":"Why is this functionality important?"},{"location":"export_atlas.html#2-decalmachine","text":"Note This section just walks you though the atlasing and export process. It's also covered in more detail in video form above . Now that you\u2019ve implemented the code above you can author your decals. You can author them with any program, but I have found nothing that works better than DECALmachine and Blender out of the box. I\u2019m actually very new to Blender and still do most of my work in Maya. However, it is still worth it to bring my models into Blender just for DECALmachine alone. I can always bring them back into Maya when I\u2019m done and Blender is free so there is very little reason not to get it. I\u2019ve placed a few decals on this cube asset to represent a final model. Once you've finished your own asset in DECALmachine and are happy with how everything looks then it is time to create an atlas. This is a very powerful feature in DECALmachine so definitely take some time to go through the Atlasing section above. To create a new atlas from the decals you have placed you need to open up the DECALmachine sidebar in Blender by hitting the N hotkey. Then click on the MACHIN3 tab and go to the Decal, Atlas & Trim Sheet Creation section. Click Create new Decal Atlas from Scene , then re-pack/tweak as needed. Once you\u2019re happy, you need to Store selected Atlas . Next, Select your Atlas in in the export panel , and have your decals Use the Atlas . Now we can export the textures we need to set up everything in UE4. Your export panel should look something like this Make sure you have masks enabled in the Channel Packed section. The four drop down menus should be set to the following: Subset Occlusion Alpha Subset Occlusion None That is going to create our Opacity Mask that we talked about in Step 1 , which is the most important texture in getting this all to look correct in Unreal.

Before we do that however, I like to finish my textures in Substance Painter so that I can customize my atlas\u2019 materials.

I\u2019ll explain how in the next step. For this step I use Substance Painter, but you are free to do this however you like. In Painter it\u2019s easy to add wear and dirt to my decals, etc. To do this I bring the following maps, that I have just exported into Painter: Curvature AO Normal Subset Then I use these maps to generate my final atlas textures for UE4. I use the Subset texture as to mask where I want the materials of my decals to be - metal and paint in this instance. The vent in the bottom right is solely in the normal map so it doesn\u2019t receive any materials. Here is what the cube looks like in Painter when I\u2019m done.

It should look like the image below when done. use the inverted subset mask to apply black color If you do this correctly it will automatically work in UE4. This is due to how we exported the masks texture in Step 2 . It\u2019s complicated, but all you need to know is if your decal only has its normal map showing then it should be colored black for your diffuse / base color texture. At this point you can export your final textures from Painter. After that, you should have a Base Color, Packed Roughness/Metallic, and a Normal Map.

And of course we are going to using mesh decals for this workflow, not decal actors . There are many reasons for this, but performance alone is worth it. The cons versus using a projected decal actor is, that you cannot move them around in engine. However, DECALmachine makes adjusting them easy and you just need to re-export the mesh again. First, create a material and call it whatever you like. This will be your decal material. In the materials Details tab change the material domain, blend mode, and decal blend mode, to the properties above. Now it\u2019s just a matter of plugging in all of the maps we\u2019ve created into their correct locations. Plug in your Base Color, Metallic, Roughness, and Normal to their corresponding channels. The only new part of this process is the masks texture we exported in Step 2 . Make sure you leave that texture set to sRGB in its properties and connect it to the Opacity channel as seen below.

This was a very rudimentary example, but the pros for using decals for micro details combined with mid-poly models can be great. No more texel density issues, lower texture memory, easy to edit, modular, faster to model, etc. I hope this helped you out.

If you have previously bought DECALmachine, you can download it by going to the store's site, and then just download the latest version you have access to accordingly: Download DECALmachine from Superhive formerly known as Blender Market Download DECALmachine from Gumroad See update installation instructions for details on how to do the actual installation once you have downloaded the DECALmachine .zip file. Installation How is DECALmachine installed? See the Installation guide and follow it precisely. Note the version requirement. Does DECALmachine work in Blender 4.5-alpha/beta? Using experimental builds of Blender, you are at risk of encountering sudden failures of addons that used to work just fine the day before. I can't make any guarantees if things will keep working. Fixing things that break in experimental Blender builds will not be a priority, until the experimental build approaches release. Does DECALmachine work on macOS? Yes, 100%. MacOS users should install Blender properly, by following the official instructions . Avoid running it just from the Downloads folder! Note that, for dragging of files and folders, you need to hold down the COMMAND key. This will ensure AppTranslocation 1 is avoided. Furthermore, your download may not actually result in a .zip file , and instead extract automatically. This can and needs to be be changed in Safari settings . Does DECALmachine work on Arch Linux? Yes, 100%. In fact, I've never used Blender on anything but Linux myself. I don't use Arch btw Arch Linux users and users of other Arch based or similar rolling release distros are advised to use the official Blender builds . The Blender package in the Community repository does not supply its own Python, and does not follow official recommendations . As a consequence, your system's python version may not work properly with Blender and/or DECALmachine or any other addons. Note Use the official tarball from blender.org to be on the safe side, it comes with a bundled Python and is the correct version that Blender addons are built against. What exactly is PIL/pillow and why is it needed? PIL is not required for basic DECALmachine usage, so for using and working with decals that are supplied with DECALmachine or for 3rd party decal packs, that support DECALmachine. PIL/pillow is an image manipulation python module, used for decal creation and export, as well as for updating legacy decal assets (from previous versions of DECALmachine). You can think of it as Photoshop for python or Photoshop by code . Installation is covered in the Installation + Support video . For more details on it, check out its own documentation . Can I install PIL/pillow without an internet connection? PIL installation is done only once. An internet connection is needed, because Windows, MacOS and Linux all require a different set of installation files. To support all of these operating systems and guarantee PIL works properly, this online-installation process is the best choice and has proven to have a 100% success rate. In the past I've supplied pre-compiled versions of PIL for all three operating systems, but they often failed to work properly due to various differences in OS installations. So now the necessary files are downloaded based on a users operating system, and PIL is then compiled on the users computer, thereby ensuring it will work properly. If you have a second computer with web access and with the same OS as your workstation , you can install DECALmachine and PIL on the second computer, then copy the PIL installation over to the one without web access, and with some luck, it will work fine. You can see the path of the PIL installation in Blender's System Console Without a second computer with internet access and using the same OS, you are out of luck and won't be able to create decals and trim sheets, or take advantage of atlasing and baking. Unless you want to build from source , at which point my support ends and you are on your own. Get support Attention Note the Requirements in the installation guide. Make sure you are using the latest version . Confirm you've followed the installation instructions , including potential post-installation steps. General information To provide help, I need the following: Proof of Purchase system-info.txt generated by DECALmachine's GetSupport tool and not from Blender's Help menu pil.log file, and batch_updated.log or quarantined.log files if present Please use the Get Support tool in the help panel or in the addon preferences to create the system-info.txt and .log files, and for further instructions in the README.html file. If there are any issues with the assets detected, the GetSupport tool will also be directly accessible from the General tab of the addon preferences. please make use of the GetSupport tool Failed Installation If your DECALmachine installation fails, it's almost guaranteed, that this is due to addon/blender version mismatches, other faulty or version mismatched addons, system python version mismatches or general Blender configuration issues, such as files in Blender's addon directory that shouldn't be there. All of these can affect installation attempts of new addons and cause them to fail, as they often cause a cascade of errors. None of this would be the fault of the new addon, but all of these would be obvious from the system console output. If you encounter this and can't resolve these issues on your own, then it is essential to send me the entirety of the system console , not just a screenshot of the end. In fact the beginning is often more important in these cases. Addon Error/Exception If you are seeing an error/exception caused by DECALmachine, please also send me the system console output , ideally copied in text form, not just a single screenshot of the error popup, as that may not cover sufficient context. Keep in mind On Windows you can turn on the console from Windows > 'Toggle System Console'. On Linux and MacOS, you need start Blender from a terminal. I do not need an image of Blender's Info View and I don't need to see Blender's Python Console either. .blend file to re-produce the issue If an error only occurs in a specific .blend file or in a certain blender context and you can reproduce it, please attach the blend file to your email as well. Please remove any part of the model that doesn't contribute to the problem to keep the file size small. Contact Use eMail , not X, not Youtube, not Artstation, not Superhive messages, and not the Blender Artists thread for reporting of any issues or problems you have with the Addon. Just use email. I tend to be very responsive, but please be patient. DECALmachine How do I snap decals to a surface? When Decals are imported using the asset loaders, by default all snap settings are prepared automatically - face snapping, align to surface, etc. Snapping itself is not turned on however. The suggested method to move decals and align them is by holding down CTRL while moving decals via g . This will turn on snapping temporarily for as long as CTRL is pressed. As of version 1.8.7 the behavior to set up snapping - and thereby changing any existing snap setttings, is optional and can be disabled in the DECALmachine panel . How do I mirror decals? Decals in DECALmachine - being objects - can be mirrored using Blender's mirror modifier, as described here . Why are my panel decal materials/textures taken from the Aircraft(or any other) library? You have enabled the Panel option for this other, non-panel decal library in the addon preferences . Changing the Panel property of a decal library, requires a library reload, or alternatively a Blender restart. Don't forget to save your preferences after the reload, or before the restart. To change panel decal materials, check out the Adjust tool. Adjust will access all decal libraries marked as Panel . The Slice / Gpanel / Epanel tools will access that same pool of materials. Why aren't there any Decal Libraries in the Pie Menu? no libraries, not even the supplied ones appear in the pie menu This is default behavior when running DECALmachine 2.5 the first time in Blender 3.0. The supplied example assets need to be (batch) updated for them to work in 3.0. See this what's new section for details on why and how. If that's not it, verify you aren't using a library visibility preset , that has all libraries hidden. My Decal Libraries are LOCKED! What can I do? supplied decal libraries are locked and can't be removed or written to You are in decal-remove-mode , and it's visibly enabled via the \"Removal\" button at the very bottom of the pie menu. You can not add decals to locked decal libraries, and you can't remove decals from them either. If you find DECALmachine like this, right after starting Blender, you need to disable decal-remove-mode and save your preferences. For details on removing decals, check out decal creation , specifically the very end. Is there a way to make decals affect displacement instead of normals? Technically it's trivial to change the decal node tree to do displacement as the height maps are already supplied. But think about it, a floating decal with actual displacement? First off, the decal would need to be subdivided a lot, which can be done, but secondly what would happen to the displaced geometry? It would intersect with the base mesh the decals are floating above - you wouldn't see much of the displaced geometry, as it is sunk into the base mesh. Why doesn't the ALT + LMB key combination for alternative modes in Project, Slice, etc. work? Make sure you haven't enabled Emulate 3 Button Mouse in Blender's Input preferences. This option uses the ALT key in combination with LMB to simulate a middle mouse button, which takes precedence. If you want to keep this enabled, you can alternatively use ALT + S to call the alternative mode in the Slice tool, or ALT + D for Project , etc. Material Matching doesn't work properly! Why are the node inputs on the Principled BSDF shader node ignored? It's working exactly as intended . Only plain pbr materials are supported. Note Also check out this related information as to why. There is also this and this for matching some textures. Understand that matching materials, with arbitrary node trees (any user could have a completely different node setup for his materials) is a significant challenge in regards to development effort, performance, and maintenance. Also, from a purely practical perspective DECALmachine's main intended use cases are hard surface focused concept design and game art. For neither of these do you need to match complex, textured materials - not in Blender anyway. due to the magic of deffered decal shaders That said, matching decal to materials with more complex node trees in Blender, would be much easier to support from the developers creating material based addons, especially when those materials are procedural. For instance, Oliver J Post's instamat and smudgr addons do support matching decals. That's because he knows exactly how his materials are structured, so he was able to build a tool to connect his node outputs to the decal node groups' inputs. Decal Creation How do I create my own Decals? You can ceate decals of all 4 types directly in Blender, see Decal Creation for details. How do I create Decals from a whole folder of images? You need to first load multiple source images. Once done, the Batch Creation: All source images at once option can be enabled. The resulting instant decals will be layed out next to each other and can then be immediately added to a library using the Add to Library tool - also all at once. Can I create Decals from Alphas ? Alphas don\u2019t contain enough information to create decals from. They are just height information. Decals are normal, height, AO, curvature, mask and often subset mask. You could do without AO, curvature and height, but getting normals from height is flawed and creating the subset mask automatically is impossible. I\u2019d recommend adapting and modeling your favorite designs and create decals from that. Alternatively you could subdivide a plane A LOT and displace it using the Alpha , then create a decal from that subdivided, displaced plane. The results seem acceptable to some people . This process is prone to artefacting and does not produce subset masks however, so you are limited to Simple decals . Can I create Decals for damage and weathering effects, such as those from Quixel? The focus of DECALmachine has always been hard surface detailing, either for concept, or game art with the aim of bringing decals into deferred rendering pipeline such as Unity HDRP or UE4. As such ( normal mapped ) decals in DECALmachine don't have color, roughness or metalness textures. In Blender decal materials fetch these color, roughness and metallic properties from their parent objects through a process called material matching . The focus here is simple parameter based materials, not textured ones, and certainly not heavily weathered materials. Decals in Blender are opaque objects after all, and a generalized, automatic approach, that can match opaque decals to arbitrary user created node setups creating complex weathered materials is just not feasible and beyond the scope of what DECALmachine intends to do. If decals had color, roughness, or metalness maps, then they couldn't be material matched, and they would stand out instead of visually integrate. Furthermore, in deferred rendering such as Unity HDRP or UE4 , decal material properties for color, roughness and metalness are simply taken from the parent object's material - textured or not - simply through the nature of how decal shaders in deferred rendering work. And so again, textures for color, roughness and metalness are not needed. This lack of support for color, roughness and metalness textures in normal mapped decals, makes using DECALmachine decals for damage and weathering effects impractical, until a new decal type is introduced specifically for this purpose. Decal Export Can I bake the Decal textures, to be used in a single texture set? Yes, as of version 1.9 decal textures can be baked to their parent objects UV space. Checkout the Bake tool for details. How do you export Decals for use in Unity, Unreal Engine, etc.? In addition to baking, there are 2 more approaches to exporting in DECALmachine. Learn more them in the Export Introduction . Other Addons Is MACHIN3tools required? MASCHIN3tools is not needed, but I'd recommended to use at least some of its tools, as they are very convenient in the DECALmachine workflow. Check out the addons section. Are HardOps and BoxCutter required? HardOps and BoxCutter are not needed to use DECALmachine. HOps/BC and DM fill different niches in a hard surface workflow. DM is a finishing and detailing tool. While HOps/BC are tools for working with form and generally improve the Blender experience greatly. As such the addons complement each either very well and I'd recommend them to any DECALmachine user. Furthermore it should be noted, that the HardOps and BoxCuter developers have been and continue to be extremely supportive and helpful and DECALmachine would not be what it is, without their initial contributions and guidance. Why can't I access DECALmachine's pie menu when I activate BoxCutter's tool? If you make BoxCutter active, by pressing its button in the tool bar, or via the Alt + W shortcut, BoxCutter takes over and brings up its own pie menu when pressing the D key. To avoid keymap conflicts and use DECCALmachine while the BoxCutter tool is active, you need to either remap the BoxCutter pie menu or the DECALmachine pie to a different key or key combination. For instance, you could remap the BC pie to SHIFT + D . Once done, you can keep the BoxCutter tool active, access its own pie menu using SHIFT + D , as well as DECALmachine's with D . Otherwise, you will have to disable the BoxCutter tool(enable any other tool) every time to access DECALmachine's pie menu. the BoxCutter pie menu, remapped to SHIFT + D in the Keymap preferences Learn more about AppTranslocation . \u21a9","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq.html#contents","text":"Purchase and Update Installation Get Support Using DECALmachine Creating Decals Exporting Decals Other Addons","title":"Contents"},{"location":"faq.html#purchase-and-update","text":"","title":"Purchase and Update"},{"location":"faq.html#where-can-i-purchase-decalmachine","text":"All my addons are sold on two markets: Buy DECALmachine on Superhive formerly known as Blender Market Buy DECALmachine on Gumroad","title":"Where can I purchase DECALmachine?"},{"location":"faq.html#how-to-get-the-update","text":"If you have previously bought DECALmachine, you can download it by going to the store's site, and then just download the latest version you have access to accordingly: Download DECALmachine from Superhive formerly known as Blender Market Download DECALmachine from Gumroad See update installation instructions for details on how to do the actual installation once you have downloaded the DECALmachine .zip file.","title":"How to get the update?"},{"location":"faq.html#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"faq.html#how-is-decalmachine-installed","text":"See the Installation guide and follow it precisely.

Also, from a purely practical perspective DECALmachine's main intended use cases are hard surface focused concept design and game art. For neither of these do you need to match complex, textured materials - not in Blender anyway. due to the magic of deffered decal shaders That said, matching decal to materials with more complex node trees in Blender, would be much easier to support from the developers creating material based addons, especially when those materials are procedural.

As such ( normal mapped ) decals in DECALmachine don't have color, roughness or metalness textures. In Blender decal materials fetch these color, roughness and metallic properties from their parent objects through a process called material matching . The focus here is simple parameter based materials, not textured ones, and certainly not heavily weathered materials. Decals in Blender are opaque objects after all, and a generalized, automatic approach, that can match opaque decals to arbitrary user created node setups creating complex weathered materials is just not feasible and beyond the scope of what DECALmachine intends to do. If decals had color, roughness, or metalness maps, then they couldn't be material matched, and they would stand out instead of visually integrate. Furthermore, in deferred rendering such as Unity HDRP or UE4 , decal material properties for color, roughness and metalness are simply taken from the parent object's material - textured or not - simply through the nature of how decal shaders in deferred rendering work. And so again, textures for color, roughness and metalness are not needed.

Latest DECALmachine The latest version of DECALmachine is 2.4.2 released on June 7th, 2025 - available on Superhive formerly known as Blender Market and Gumroad . See this page to learn what's new in the latest versions, or see the changelog for the full, detailed release history. How to Install? Blender 4.2+ Drag and Drop Installation Blender supports drag and dropping addon .zip files (both legacy and extension addons!) from your system's filebrowser on the open Blender application to do the installation. This is super convenient, and also works for update installations, but you should always restart Blender after updating to a new addon version. Otherwise, the traditional ways to install described below also work. Fresh Installation If you don't have a previous version of DECALmachine installed, you should follow the default installation process, from the .zip file. installation from the Addons tab of Blender's preferences, by selecting the addon's .zip file Update Installation previous version of DECALmachine installed already Attention The video below applies to updating from DECALmachine 2.11 (or later). If you are updating from an earlier version of DECALmachine, that doesn't have the Integrated Updater yet, please see these legacy update instructions . Unfold it from the top of the DECALmachine addon preferences. Select the DECALmachine zip file to install, if it's in your home dir or Downloads folder, it will be found automatically. Verify it's the version you want, and Quit Blender to install the update, otherwise remove it. Post-Installation PIL/Pillow For more advanced usage of DECALmachine, a python module called PIL/Pillow is required. PIL enables DECALmachine to manipulate images, and so is required for Decal and Trim Sheet Creation, as well as for Atlasing and Baking . Installation has been automated and is covered below. Some additional information can be found the FAQs . Keep in mind If you use DECALmachine 2.4.2 in Blender 4.3+, you will need PIL to update the supplied example assets . Move Assets Location After a fresh Installation, when unfolding the addon preferences , you will always be greeted with this message, asking you to move your assets location elsewhere, and out of the DECALmachine addon folder. I highly recommend you follow this advice, and when you do so, pay attention to the Move toggle. If this is the first time you are going to use an outside assets location for DECALmachine, you should set the Move toggle to True . With it enabled, all assets from the current location will be moved to the new location, as you change the assets path. If on the other hand you have used DECALmachine before and have a previous asset location for it setup already somewhere, or if you use a shared assets location as part of a team, you should disable this toggle before you change the assets location. Update Legacy Assets Depending on the Blender version you are using with DECALmachine, an update even of the supplied example assets may be required. This is currently the case when using DECALmachine 2.4.2 in Blender 4.3 and 4.4, but not when using the same version of DECALmachine in Blender 4.2 LTS. A Batch Updater message like this - or similar - may show in the DECALmachine addon preferences This will also be the case for any assets you have created previously, and it may also be the case for any 3rd party decal libraries, that you may want to import and use. The reason for this is, that every time Blender introduces changes to materials with an update, in particular to the Principled BSDF shader node, DECALmachine will try to make use of any new features and ensure they they are properly supported in all your previously created decal assets too. Decal Materials being in sync with Blender's latest materials is essential for Material Matching too. As an example for instance, Blender 4 introduced foldable panels on shaders and node groups, and DECALmachine 2.9+ makes full use of these in its decal- or trimsheet node groups. Decal Node Groups with panels in Blender 4 Changes like these will require an update of all previously saved decal assets and libraries, and also an update of all .blend files, that still use these legacy assets. At least if you want to continue to work on them - they should still render and display fine even without being updated. The two tools used for this are: UpdateDecalLibrary and UpdateBlendFiles . In addition and for convenience there is a BatchUpdater, that iteratively calls the UpdateDecalLibrary tool for each legacy decal or trimsheet libraries in your chosen assets location. This is what's shown above in the screenshot, exposing the Update and Fix Them All button. Issues with Assets Go to the next page covering the addon preferences , to learn more about dealing with failed asset registrations. Special Case: Blender on MacOS MacOS users should install Blender properly, by following the official instructions . Avoid running it just from the Downloads folder! Note that, for dragging of files and folders, you need to hold down the COMMAND key. This will ensure AppTranslocation 1 is avoided. Furthermore, your download may not actually result in a .zip file , and instead extract automatically. This can and needs to be be changed in Safari settings .

Decal Materials being in sync with Blender's latest materials is essential for Material Matching too. As an example for instance, Blender 4 introduced foldable panels on shaders and node groups, and DECALmachine 2.9+ makes full use of these in its decal- or trimsheet node groups. Decal Node Groups with panels in Blender 4 Changes like these will require an update of all previously saved decal assets and libraries, and also an update of all .blend files, that still use these legacy assets. At least if you want to continue to work on them - they should still render and display fine even without being updated. The two tools used for this are: UpdateDecalLibrary and UpdateBlendFiles . In addition and for convenience there is a BatchUpdater, that iteratively calls the UpdateDecalLibrary tool for each legacy decal or trimsheet libraries in your chosen assets location. This is what's shown above in the screenshot, exposing the Update and Fix Them All button.","title":"Update Legacy Assets"},{"location":"installation.html#issues-with-assets","text":"Go to the next page covering the addon preferences , to learn more about dealing with failed asset registrations.","title":"Issues with Assets"},{"location":"installation.html#special-case-blender-on-macos","text":"MacOS users should install Blender properly, by following the official instructions .

This moves it into your chosen assets location. From there, you can use the Batch Updater . Batch Updating For convenience, the Batch Updater allows you to update everything in your chosen assets location at once using just a single button press. You can use the Batch Updater directly from the addon preferences or from the sidebar panel. It will only be revealed when update-able assets are detected in your assets location.

No asset update is required this time around, if you have done so in 4.3 already. The supplied assets are still suitable for 4.2 however, and so if you do a fresh installation in Blender 4.3 or 4.4 and you want to use the supplied assets, you have to update them accordingly, same as in the previous release .

I never released a version like this and you can you check my changelog for a list of my actual releases. It's highly likely this contains malware, and I advice you to support original creators and install their original, creator-supplied releases only. This is the Blender 4.3 release. And with it I'm raising the minimum Blender version from 3.6 LTS to to 4.2 LTS. The following video goes over the major changes and additions of this release. Note Raising the minimum version to Blender 4.2, allowed me to update the supplied Example assets , so they are now ready-to-use in 4.2, after installation. However, since Blender 4.3 introduced the new Diffuse Roughness property on the Principled BSDF shader node, an asset update is required in Blender 4.3.

Determine which decal types should be selected from the redo panel after invoking the tool the Select tool can now be accessed from the pie, in addition to the dbl-LEFTMOUSE keymap Keep in mind You can use DQ - pressed in sequence - to access the Select tool from the pie menu Adjust Decals tool Parts of the Adjust tool have been optimized and the options available and hints given are now more contextual and depend on your specific decal selection. see the Overview video above, for details For all decals smoothing can now be toggled via the F key. For Info decals you can now easily adjust the Alpha using the A key. Smoothing and non-MESH objects Most tools now support decals on non-MESH objects, in particular CURVE objects, but also SURFACE and META objects. You can now insert decals on, re-apply decals on, project on, slice on, and gpanel and epanel on these object types. projected and sliced decals on curve objects Furthermore, whenever possible, these tools now enforce the same shading - smooth or flat - on decals, that is used by the decal target or parent objects. Shrinkrap On mesh objects, you can now shrinkrap panel decals using the project tool . This helps better conforming them to curved surfaces, while requiring less surface distance, but does increase the evaluated face count. Using the unwrap tool , you can now (mesh-level) shrinkwrap panel decals on MESH, CURVE, SURFACE and meta objects too. Shrinkwrap in-place of Project available for Panel Decals Material Overrides I've added a new Coat Material Override preset, and expose the Coat Weight for all 4 presets accordingly the new Coat Material Override Preset, with Decals set to \"Under-Coat\" The other presets also expose the Coat Weight property now. TGA Atlasing Decal atlases can now be created in the TGA format. Decal Atlases can now be creatd in TGA format common in game pipelines more As always, please see the changelog for the full list of changes. 2.12 2024-08-17 This is finally the Blender 4.2 release. I appreciate everyone's patience with this. This concludes the 4.2 updates to my suite of addons. CURVEmachine , MESHmachine , MACHIN3tools and now DECALmachine have all received updates, while PUNCHit works fine as is. Eevee Next, Thin Film Interference As in many previous releases, whenever Blender introduces changes to materials or new Principled BSDF shader inputs, an asset update is usually inevitable, so previously created and set up decals and trim sheets can support and make use of those changes. Blender 4.2 and with it DECALmachine 2.12 is no different. The asset update is easy, and has been made very robust over the previous releases. Once the decal and trim sheet libraries themselves have been updated, any existing .blend files using decals and trimsheets made with a previous version should be updated too, especially if you plan to continue working in them. Note that with Blender 4.2 in particular, opening legacy blend files may result in black decals, because Blender automatically adds somes additional nodes, which I don't think work quite as intended. The blend file updater will get rid of this and restore properly functioning decal materials. Blend file updates now take material overrides and under-coating into into account. Decal Creation and Baking In the sidebar panels for decal creation and decal export via baking , the cycles device selection has been exposed directly for convenience now. GPU/CPU selection for decal creation and export via baking Example Files The supplied example files have been updated to avoid the black decal issue in Blender 4.2 mentioned earlier. I think many users, in particular new ones, may actually not be aware that these files are shipped with DECALmachine at all, so I invite you to have a look, if this is the case: Check out Decal Basics, Decal Asset and Trim Sheet Asset in particular, all from the help panel. misc Note I decided against raising the minimum Blender version to 4.2 for this release. That means DECALmachine 2.12 still supports Blender all the way back to 3.6. As a consequence the supplied decal and trim sheet assets are made for 3.6 still, and require the above mentioned updates when using Blender 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2. Again, I appreciate your patience with this update. For some context, I actually started work on 4.2 updates of my addons on July 1st already, but that turned out to be not sufficient, mostly due to the massive MACHIN3tools 1.10 update . I chose to work on that first, because MACHIN3tools is a more generic, less specialized tool set, hence the delay with DECALmachine. Thanks for your support, much appreciated! 2.11.2 2024-04-08 A tiny bugfix release, addressing an exception when importing a Trimsheet in Blender 4.0 or 4.1. This release also fixes an issue of delayed trimsheet or atlas registration. I would consider this an optional update, if you didn't run into these issues, which I asssume is the vast majority of users. See the changelog for details. 2.11.1 2024-03-28 This is a Hotfix release , that deals with an undocumented and unannounced change in Blender behavior, where it no longer allows for name-swapping . As a result, Decals updated in Blender 4.1 would save Decal Materials incorrectly - with an index suffix in the name: LIBRARY_DECAL.001 . The Slice , GPanel , Epanel and Adjust tools are affected by this, as they try to directly import the Panel Decal material (by name). DECALmachine 2.11.1 now handles this in two ways: It re-introduces a way to do name-swapping, thereby preventing decal materials being saved with an incorrect name. It supports appending decal materials, that have previously been saved incorrectly. This way, no addtional update of already-updated Decals is necessary. Just install this bugfix version of DECALmachine, and they will work as you'd expect. To do the update - and IF you are updating from 2.11.0 - I can now recommend, that you use the new Integrated Updater , introduced in DECALmachine 2.11.0. This should be the most convenient way to do an update installation, from inside of Blender instead of the filebrowser, while still keeping addon preferennces intact, and even assets, that are still in the addon folder, as long as you keep that option enabled. See the changelog for a list of all changes. 2.11 2024-03-19 This is a small release, and for the most part only brings Blender 4.1 support with its changes in (Auto)Smooth behavior , that affected decal creation. Get Support The GetSupport tool has been made more accessible and is placed at the top of the addon preferences It will now - in Blender 4.1 - automatically open the readme.html with instructions in your web browser. Those same instructions can be found here in the docs of course. Integrated Updater Finally, there is now an integrated way to do an update installation still from a .zip file! from inside of Blender. So no longer, will you have to do it from the file browser, to maintain your previous settings. It also - by default - ensures your decal or trim sheet assets are not lost, should you have kept them in the addon location still. Also placed at the top of the addon preferences: the new integrated updater If you have just downloaded your future DECALmachine update, the updater will find it for you! Keep in mind Since this feature is only introduced now in 2.11, it will only be of use for upcoming releases, so can't be used to install this very 2.11 update yet. In the screenshot above, old versions are used for demonstration. But of course you could downgrade with this tool as well. more As always, check the changelog for a list of all changes. Pricing I've decided to bump the price a little, to counter a general downtrend in revenue, in face of rising living and so development costs, that I have observed for over a year now. The reasons for this are not clear, but it's likely a mix of multiple: post-COVID era, reaching market saturation (?), increased competition, lack of new products and social media activity, while my main focus remains on getting HyperCursor out, gen AI, inflation, layoffs, etc. For now, I still want to avoid charging for updates, but it may be inevitable. I'll see how it goes. If you are still reading, note that I have a Patreon account, and HyperCursor is in pre-release. Thanks for your support! 2.10 2024-01-22 This update's main focus is to make the tooling around asset updates and asset version validation a lot more robust, and handle any potential issues and failure cases more gracefully. Note Assets that have been updated successfully in 2.9 already, do not need another update in 2.10 again. DM 2.10 just further improves on this process and aims to make it more accessable. Asset Update and Validation While only a small part of users are affected by problems when updating asset libraries, when it does happen, it is understandably very frustrating. DECALmachine 2.10 addresses this by being more robust, and by being a lot more transparent about what is happening, and what can be done, if a decal library fails to register. Batch Update popup message, the same info is also written to a log file Two of the most common failure scenarios can now be dealt with automatically by the Update Decal Libary tool and so by the Batch Updater too. Ambiguous Decal Libararies, containing multiple version indicator files User-manipulated version indicator files causing a decal vs. library version mismatch If other issues are encountered in the update process, then individual Decals will now be skipped. Skipped Decals in a previous update attempt, moved to a dedicated location for further investigation Quarantined assets, also moved to a dedicated location for further investigation In line with these updates, I've updated the docs accordingly. In particular I've added this Post-Intallation section to the installation instructions. I have also expanded and updated the Failed Asset Registration section on the addon preferences page, and I have updated the pages about the Update Decal Libary and Update Blend File tools. These last two were also massively generalized and simplified, and will now deal with any version you throw at them, in favor of having dedicated per-version update ops as before. Update Legacy .blend files As introduced in DECALmachine 2.9 already, when you open a .blend file containing legacy assets, a fading message will be drawn directly in the viewport to let you know about their presence. Going one step further, a number of tools will now actively resist working with legacy decals, until they are updated to avoid unexpected issues before they can come up. Admittedly this should have been done with DECALmachine 1.8 already, when versioned assets where first introduced as a distinction to pre-Blender 2.80 decals. Finally, the Update panel in the sidebar now lists all the legacy decals in the current .blend file. Get Support Last but not least, I have further simplified the support process. easily get support, directly from the general tab of the addon preferences, when an issue is detected At the same time, I provide myself with more information about the state if your assets location, via more verbose output in the generated system_info.txt file. This will ensure, that you won't have to share your entire assets folder with me, just so I can see what is going wrong, and where. example output written to the system_info.txt file generated by the GetSupport tool As always, check out the changelog for a comprehensive list of all changes, that went into this 2.10.0 release. Thank you Big shout-out to Vesper, Collin and Rares, and a few others who I don't remember by name right now, who were kind enough to share their entire assets folders with me recently. Thank you for this, and for your patience, as it allowed me to make this entire process as robust as it is right now. Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e 2.9 23-12-16 Blender 4.0 + Asset Update DECALmachine 2.9 brings support for Blender 4.0, released last month. Since Blender 4.0 introduced a number of changes to the Principled BSDF shader node, which decal materials make use of, an asset update is required again, IF you use Blender 4 (instead of 3.6 LTS). That means - as before - users of Blender 4.0 will be greeted with a message about incompatible libraries being found in the assets location. with PIL/pillow installed , you can easily update them all at once DECALmachine 2.9 in Blender 3.6 can be used right away. But note, that once you have updated the assets for use in Blender 4, you won't be able to use those same assets in Blender 3.6 anymore. Updated assets will appear as incompatible, but there is no way to downgrade them again. When loading a .blend file with legacy decals (decals that should be updated), a 5 second fading warning will be drawn at the bottom of the 3D view, to let you know about it. Please run the Blend File update tool(s) accordingly, which you can find in the Update Panel. This behavior can be disabled in the addon preferences Note You should always update decal libraries first, before you update blend files that make use of legacy decals. Asset Location Change You now have the option to not move assets from the current to a new location, when you change the assets location. In addition, the way how assets are moved - should you chose to do so - has been completely revamped. DECALmachine will now check existing folder names in the target location and prevent overwriting them, which in previous versions, had the potential to create ambiguous libraries (multiple version indicator files) in the process. Instead, if DM now encounters libraries in the new assets location, that are named like the ones in the old location, then those libraries will be moved out of the Atlases/Decals/Trims folders into dedicated _Collision folders. This way nothing is ever lost, or changed, and you can investigate yourself, if you still need these libararies. Failed Asset Registration As in the previous versions, DECALmachine will not register libraries that are ambiguous, corrupt, or invalid . Instead of just leaving it at that, you can now move these libraries into quarantine. This gets rid of the warnings, by moving the offending libraries into dedicated _Quarantine folders, where they can be further investigated. If _Quarantine folders are detected, you will be shown the following section in the addon preferences. Trim Sheet Creation - Snapping Some users asked for more precision when setting up trims in DECALmachine, so now you can chose between or mix 3 different snapping types: There is a custom, divisor based adjustable snapping method. In addition there is pixel snapping, which also switches the trim sheet textures to Closest Interpolation to properly show the pixels you are working with. And finally there is object/mesh based snapping, where the vert locations of a references mesh object, determine where you can snap your trims. In this case, you can even display the reference mesh, projected on the sheet. Material Overrides You can now set up temporary, non-destructive Material Overrides. This was added based on a suggestion and premliminary work by Justo Figueroa . Simply select one or multiple objects and run the Material Override tool from the Defaults section of the DECALmachine side bar panel in the 3D View. You can then tweak the parameters of the DECALmachine Override node tree directly in the side bar, or you can pick one of the pre-made commonly used presets. You can also edit the node tree, and for example add additional output parameters. Enable fake-user if you want it to stick around, or pick and use a completely custom made Override Node tree. You can undo Material Overrides per-object by ALT clicking on the Override Materials button, or you can clear the node tree selector, which removes the overrides everywhere. Under/Over Coating The Legacy Asset Update in Blender 4.0 will do a small tweak to the decal node groups used by all decal materials. This tweak enables a new decal material feature called Under/Over Coating . Also accessed from the Defautls section of the DECAlmachine side bar panel in the 3D Wiew, this allows you to create the appearance of simple/subset/panel decals sitting under a smooth, glossy surface, or being above it, thereby creating an impression on the surface. For now, and as a consequence of DECALmachine re-using decal materials and node trees whenever possible, this is a global setting affecting all decals in a blend file. And so if you want to change this behavior for only a selection of decals, you will have to set it up manually. More As always there have been more tweaks and changes, and you should check out the full changlog , if you are curious. Also, here's a teaser for some integration work between DECALmachine 2.9 and the upcoming MACHIN3tools 1.7 release, and its updated Bevel Shader setup now supporting Panel Decals. 2.8.1 2023-08-20 This is a tiny fix, to resolve panel trim unwrap issues in Blender 3.6 caused by changes in Blender's unwrapping behavior. Rectangulating the active face should now be extremely reliable even with that new behavior, which in turn allows you to properly panel unrap a face selection consistently in 3.6. 2.8 2023-06-29 Blender 3.6 - a new LTS release is out, and it finally allows for the complete removal of the legacy bgl module. Beyond the bgl removal, there are a few smaller tweaks and improvements to the PanelCut tool and to how HUDs are drawn. The system's UI scaling is now taken into account too. Furthermore, the DECALmachine sidebar panel can now be completely disabled in the addon prefs, but note that you will lose access to various advanced DECALmachine features, including decal creation and export, if you hide the panels. See the changelog for a list of all changes Last, but not least, check out Arturo V\u00e1zquez's awesome trimsheet on artstation: And his work too! 2.7.2 2023-04-21 This is a small bugfix release addressing an undocumented API change in CAGE_2D gizmos' draw_style , resulting in trim/atlas gizmos being drawn as ellipses, instead of rectangles in Blender 3.5. Furthermore, decals placed on non-uniformly scaled objects will now be properly oriented. Keep in mind however, that the Normal Transfer will not produce the desired result for these cases, and you should disable it for decals on objects like these. Ideally however, just apply the scale and avoid working on non-uniformly scaled objects all together, if possible. 2.7.1 2022-12-30 Bugfix release addressing issues caused by 3.4's new MIX node. See changelog for details. 2.7 2022-11-25 Blender 3.3 A small feature release, 2.7 raises the minimum Blender version to 3.3. So use Blender 3.3 LTS from now on with this version please. Dropping 2.93 LTS support allows me to finally supply DECALmachine with decal assets that work out of the box again, thereby skipping the mandatory update process, that was required since Blender 3.0, and was necessary to accommodate 2.93 LTS users. Panel Decals from info Trimsheets This update fixes an issue where panel trims/decals created from pure Info-Trimsheets (so using color- but no normal-map), weren't accessible from the Adjust tool for panel cycling . 16-bit Normals For decal creation you can now also enable 16-bit normals in the addon preferences, in the Decal Creation tab. This should hide artifacting, especially on highly reflective decal materials. Note however, that any Atlases created from these 16-bit normal decals, will still fall back to 8-bit normals. This is due to a limitation in PIL unfortunately. experimental float normals for decal creation UI and Documentation tweaks Furthermore, developer extraordinair proxeIO has submitted a patch to improve how decal libraries are drawn in the pie, enforcing square thumbnails. And finally the docs received a minor face lift and now feature collapsible sub menus in the navigation bar. how to get DECALmachine support 2.6.5 This is a tiny bugfix release. It provides a workaround for a Blender issue , that has expanded in scope with the 3.2.2 release. This was causing modal HUDs to be drawn off-screen for the Adjust, Unwrap Trim, Match and Panel Cut tools. 2.6.4 Blender 3.2 breaks material matching if Decals. This tiny bugfix releases resolves it. 2.6.3 Yet another bugfix release, this time fixing a uber-rare issue where the addon preferences or Decal update panel could become very sluggish. I've also added small, one-time thank you message, when opening the addon preferences for the first time. 2.6.2 Besides a few minor tweaks and adjustments 2.6.2 resolves a MacOS issue when registering Atlases caused by .DS_store files 2.6.1 This is a hotfix release, dealing with an issue introduced in Blender 3.1 / Python 3.10. Atlasing and Decal-from-Text-Creation were affected by this, and will now work again. 2.6.0 This is the Blender 3.1 release. In addition to 3.1 support, 2.6.0 also introduces the concept of corrupted libraries in an effort to further harden asset registration and prevent user errors. DECALmachine always assumed that any folder in a decal or trim sheet library, contains a decal or trim decal accordingly. If instead there are any other user-placed folders, DECALmachine will now no longer register the library and will also not attempt to update it. And that's about it. Lately, I was rather occupied with PUNCHit and MACHIN3tools and even some design work for once. Oh, I also have a Patreon account now, where I will do pre-releases of upcoming addons, and where I share blend files , if I manage to find time for art. So if you are interested in further supporting my work, that would be a good way to do it. It is very much appreciated! Thank you for considering! 2.5.1 This is a bugfix release, that with one exception addresses only Blender 3.0 related issues, so it's completely optional for Blender 2.93 users. The exception is what I'd call a visual bug in the Decal shaders for simple, subset and panel Decals. AO affects Roughness, but needs to be clamped This issue has been present for a long time, but it's pretty minor and rarely noticeable, as evidenced by the fact that is hasn't been reported until now. All supplied assets have been updated to clamp the AO/Roughness. Newly created User Decals will also no longer have this issue in this version. If you want to fix existing Decals you've created yourself or got from a third-party, you can do this using the Fix AO Clamping debug tool. Note, that I don't consider this a decal asset update per-se, and so there is no decal version change here. The fix can be used in 2.93 and 3.0, and for each version, only the currently registered Decal Libraries will be affected. Enable DECALmachine Debug mode, then find the Fix AO Clamping tool in the main Panel A complete list of all fixes can be seen in the changelog . 2.5 This is the Blender 3.0 release. Note, that at the time of this release, Blender 3.0 is still in beta. Alongside 3.0, Blender 2.93 LTS is still being supported, but support for any earlier versions is dropped now. This release also no longer relies on Blender's bgl module for VIEW3D drawing. However, if you want DECALmachine to draw smooth, anti-aliased lines, you need to enable Use Legacy Line Smoothing in the addon preferences , which still uses bgl . Asset Update (Blender 3.0 only) Blender 3.0 introduces 2 new node inputs on the Principled BSDF shader node. And although I doubt many people will actually use them, an asset update is required to properly support these inputs for material matching. Since Blender 2.93 does not have these node inputs, the asset update will only be available in Blender 3.0. And so understand, that DECALmachine 2.5 on Blender 3.0 will expect differently versioned Decals and Trim Sheets, than the same DECALmachine version run on Blender 2.93. Also understand, that once you have updated your decals to the new version in Blender 3.0, you won't be able to use those same Decals in Blender 2.93 anymore. Keep in mind There is no downgrade tool, so make a backup of your existing decals, before you update them, if you want to keep them for later use in Blender 2.93. As an unfortunate consequence of this, the supplied example assets provided by DECALmachine are not updated for Blender 3.0 yet, as otherwise they wouldn't work in Blender 2.93 anymore. So if you install DECALmachine 2.5 on Blender 3.0, the first thing you will have to do is update all assets. This is conveniently done from the addon preferences . the batch updater in the addon preferences Blend File Update If you want to continue working on blend files created with previous DECALmachine/Blender versions, you need to update those blend files as well. Note Before you update blend files, make sure you have updated the Decal and/or Trim Sheet libraries first! Updating blend files is done from the Update Panel in the 3D view . The Validate tool has been updated to identify the latest decal version - which is 2.5 in Blender 3.0. If the tool encounters an incompatible version, it will now also point out the expected version, depending on the Blender version you use. Update Installation If you are updating from a previous version of DECALmachine, I recommend doing the installation in the filebrowser , as it allows you to keep your existing addon preferences intact. Asset Registration Decal, Trim Sheet and Atlas registration continues to become more robust, and DECALmachine is now much more picky about what it does register and what it doesn't. This is an attempt to avoid various user errors, and simplify debugging of related issues. To help with any failed registration attempts, there is now more verbose output in the system console, as well as in the system info generated by the GetSupport tool. There will also be warnings in the addon preferences accordingly(also seen above ). Decal and Trim Sheet Material Deduplication This version improves deduplication of Decal and Trim Sheet materials. Dedplication always happens automatically in the background, and the improvements should lead to viewport performance improvements, especially in scenes with many Decal or Trim Sheet Materials - although I haven't done any testing in that regard. Furthermore, I've resolved an oversight, which caused no deduplication happening at all, when initiating Trim Sheet materials on objects without any existing material. More There's more, such as improvements in the RemoveOrphans tool, or improved MyDecal collision handling when changing the assets path to an external location, which is highly recommended . Decals I've added a new 3rd party decal pack from Unis to the decal resources section, featuring 100 unique fasteners, check it out ! 2.4.1 A small bugfix release in response to Blender 2.93.4 breaking the TrimCut tool. This release also addresses some some rare MacOS and Linux issues, that have come up. 2.4.0 This release focuses mostly on improving the general workflow in DECALmachine and it tries to iron out various usability kinks. A lot of this in direct response to user suggestions, so thank you for providing feedback, and a big shoutout to funcom . Decal Creation Starting off with decal creation , you can now easily name info decals created from images, based on the source images' file names. With a decal name taken from the source file, or when when using a custom name, you will now also have the option to skip the index. Furthermore, subset components on normal mapped decals can now be stored with a custom material - instead of the default metalic one - directly on the decal asset file. Library Visibility + Presets Decal and Trim Sheet Library management has been improved by the introduction of visibility toggles accessed directly from the 3D view , as well as visibility presets. Adjust Decal Adjust Decal has been tweaked to avoid undesired height changes, as well as to support cycling through a small subset of registered panel decals, instead of all of them. Transferring UVs/Textures aka Texture Matching Matching textures has always been possible , however I was hesitant to automate it because a decal parent's material can have arbitrary levels of complexity, and supporting every node tree setup under the sun is just not feasible and risks significant performance degradation. That's also why I was encouraging for 3rd party material addons to support DECALmachine, instead of the other way around. It's easy for them as they are in control of their own complexity and all that's required there is plugging in their nodes into the decal group nodes. 2.4 now supports texture matching a very specific node setup: UVed Image Textures directly connected to a Principled BSDF shader node. This can be further automated in future, but for now it's done manually using the Transfer UVs tool.

See the changelog for details. Of note is the addition of forced UUID support for advanced decal creation. While the majority of users will want to leave this option disabled, it can be used in pipelines, that build on DECALmachine's decal UUIDs and that require a lot of iteration. Enabled, forced UUIDs will ensure UUIDs are re-used, whenever a decal is re-created from source geometry, that was previously used for decal creation. New Decal Packs 2 new Decal Packs have been added to the decal resources section, check them out: Ihara Saikaku's Memento Aurora Heart Decals Yigit Kilinc's Sleek Sci-Fi Decal Pack 2.2.0 Blender 2.92 had its stable release this week, and so DECALmachine 2.2 should be working fine with it based on some limited testing. If you come across any issues, please report them . If you are updating from a previous version of DECALmachine, please note the installation instructions in regards to updates. Keep in mind Blender 2.9 3 is currently in very early alpha state. Being the next LTS release, it will bring various deeper changes - incl. a new Python version - many of which are potentially addon-breaking and have broken DECALmachine 2.1 already. While 2.93 won't be officially supported until it nears its stable release, DECALmachine 2.2 does seem work with recent alpha builds. Until it doesn't. . Sweep Decal Backups Just like there's a Sweep Stashes tool in MESHmachine , there's now a similar tool for decal backups in DECALmachine 2.2. GPU Decal Creation It's now possible to use the GPU when creating decals . Decals Galore It's amazing to see that DECALmachine users have been busy creating and sharing decals. Check out these awesome new decal packs, and visit the decal resources page for more.

Decal materials in DECALmachine build on this shader and expose most of it's inputs to the decal group's inputs. And so DECALmachine 2.1 introduces full support for Emission Strength , even going back to Blender 2.83 and 2.90, which don't provide that input on the Principled BSDF node. Batch Update Decal Libraries To enable this, all decals you may have created in DECALmachine 2.0.x will need to be updated. You can still follow a process identical to the previous approach of updating Decals created in 1.8 - 1.9.4 for DECALmachine 2.0. Or you can use the new BatchUpdate tool , which will update all Decal libraries - including Trim Sheet libraries - created in DECALmachine 1.8 - 2.0.1 in one go. With the new BatchUpdate tool, and it's availability directly from the addon preferences, you can now also import legacy decals from the preferences, without the popup telling you that it can't be done. Just import any 1.8-2.0.1 library or libraries, and update it/them with a single button. Easy. Note, that I have removed the ability to update Decals created in DECALmachine 1.4.x/Blender 2.79. If you still have to do this, do it before you install DECALmachine 2.1. Set Trim UV Layer Index There are also a few improvements, including the ability to choose in the addon preferences, what UV layer to use for Trims Sheets, as well as a workaround to prevent an annoying and as of yet unresolved Blender undo crash. Check out the changelog for details. Installation / Update from 2.0.x This is how I'd suggest to install if you are updating from version 2.0.x. open the addon preferences and find DECALmachine 2.0.x if your assets path is not pointing to an an external location(outside of Blender's addons folder), change that now pick a different folder and all your assets will automatically be copied to your chosen location deactivate DECALmachine(don't remove just yet!), save your preferences, and restart Blender open the addon preferences, remove DECALmachine 2.0.x and install DECALmachine 2.1 from the zip file change your assets path to your external location if you had any custom Decals or Trim Sheets among your libraries, DECALmachine will detect it now and offer to update them all at once Decal Resources The decal resources page has been updated, and a new trim sheet resources page was added. Support decal/trim sheet creators and feel free to submit your own! 2.0.1 The 2.0.0 release has proven to be extremly solid, and so more than a month after the release, only a handful of rare issues required tweaking or fixing. Check out the changelog for details. 2.0.0 This release has been in development for exactly one year. DECALmachine 1.9 released on September 4th 2019 , and I tweeted the first time about 2.0 on September 11th . And so first and foremost, I want to thank everybody who was patient, supportive and encouraging along the way. I want to welcome and thank all the new DECALmachine users who bought DM over the past year too. You have financed this endeavor in large part. 3 people have been instrumental in the development of this release by testing and providing essential feedback: Aleksandre Lortkipanidze Thad Clevenger Alen Lapidis DECALmachine 2.0 would not be in the state it is in without them, so thank you guys! Thanks also go to Ponte Ryuurui and Josh Gambrell aka the Blender Bros , whose constant stream of educational videos definitely generated interest in my addons, in times when my output was limited to endless previews. They have a new free Decal Pack for DECALmachine 2.0 available right now! Last but not least, I want to thank the Blender developers, as their constant innovation, enabled some of the things in this release in the first place, specifically the fantastic gizmo system. So what's actually new then? Code A lot is new. The amount of code has doubled since 1.9. And that's because the two main features of version 2 - Atlasing and Trim Sheets - both go deep and are fairly complex. Thankfully, the complete rewrite for 1.8 and so Blender 2.80, set me up perfectly for this. Documentation Complex in code, but hopefully not complex for the user. I did my best to make these features as simple to use and as accessible as possible. And so with the update in code, also comes a major update in documentation. There are 30 new videos - over 3 hours of new content. Decals In addition, Decals themselves have also received an update and now support emission and transmission (and transparency). To facilitate this, you need to update your Decals created in previous versions. Existing tools like Decal Creation , Match Material, Adjust etc. have been updated to support the new Decal materials. Installation & Support Please check out the installation instructions , especially if you have a previous version of DECALmachine installed! Note For this and the following videos, I highly recommend you check out the relevant pages in the docs, instead of just watching the videos, as the docs provide context and additional information. DECALmachine 2.0 is all about getting your Decals from Blender to Unity, Unreal Engine or any other game engine. It's the export release . Baking was introduced in 1.9, but still has issues outside of my control. But baking Decals was never an optimal workflow anyway. Have a look at this Export Introduction for all of DECALmachine's export capabilities. this video was released early, so you may have seen it already Atlasing Atlasing allows you to pack individual Decals into a single Texture Sheet and then export that and the Decal objects to your engine of choice. Trim Sheets Trim Sheets are similar to Atlases, but aren't only created for export purposes. Instead, they can be used in Blender/DECALmachine and open up a new detailing workflow, that can be used instead of (or in combination with) Decals. And so Trim Sheets unlock a completely new suite of tools in DECALmachine: the Trim UV tools . These are UV tools, but can be used directly in the 3D View ! the Trim Cut tool UV Tools In addition to the Trim UV tools, there are also 3 more generic UV tools, which you may find useful outside of DECALmachine too. Join and Split A favorite of mine is the addition of the Join and Split tools, which allow you to very easily, and non-destructively keep your scene organized, even with dozens or hundreds of Decals. More There is more and I'd invite your to check out the changelog for a comprehensive list of all changes and additions. The FixTexturePaths tool for instance has become quite a bit more powerful. So please explore the documentation. Also check out the new Example Blend files! Finally, make sure you don't miss out on this free emissive decal pack from the Blender Bros. And check out their DECALmachine 2.0 content on youtube too: Ryuu , Josh . Thanks again for your patience, and for reading this far, I appreciate it and leave you with the trailer: 1.9.4 A major problem with how decals are saved Blender 2.83 has come to light. This means all decals created in 2.83 are saved wrong, with absolute texture paths. As a result, if you ever change the decal location, or move decals around to other libraries, or share them with other users, they will fail to display properly. 1.9.4 introduces a work-around for the Insert and FixTexturePaths tools to deal with this problem. Highly recommended to install. 1.9.3 This release ensures compatibility with Blender 2.83. See the changelog for details. 1.9.2 This is a tiny bug fix release, preventing an error when creating info decals from monochrome images. In addition there is a fix for recent 2.82 experimental builds, which broke the pie menu and the quick insert tool. Shoutout to Adrian from BoxCutter and HardOps fame for that! 1.9.1 This build fixes various bugs, mostly minor, but some could crash Blender, especially 2.81. Info Decal creation from JPGs has been removed. I had doubts when adding this anyway, and it turned out to cause problems for some users, so only PNGs are supported now. See the changelog for details. 1.9 1.9 represents the first major release after 1.8, which was released while Blender 2.80 was still in beta. The intermediary 1.8.1 - 1.8.7 releases were either forced, due to breaking changes in the beta, or used to carefully roll out new tools and features to reduce the wait time for the full 1.9 release. Now Blender 2.80 is stable and DECALmachine has reached a major milestone bringing back the first part of the export pipeline: the baking of decals. In addition there is a new Panel Cutting tool, as well as a tool to remove MESHCUT edges. There are new example files and the documentation has been updated to cover all changes and additions since the 1.8 release. There are 15 new videos explaining everything in detail! Installation & Support Have a look at the updated installation instructions, they now also cover how to get support . Updating Attention I've added some advice about how to update from previous versions , as there is a real risk of loosing custom decals you may have created, if you don't do it properly. Baking Baking of Decals has been vastly simplified compared to how it was done in Blender 2.79 and DECALmachine 1.4.2. Batch Info Decal Creation Batch Creation of Info Decals is now properly documented. Use Panel Decals to Cut You could always use Panel Decal's backup cutter objects to cut into an object, either manually, or by using the Mesh Cut tool in MACHIN3tools . But with the introduction of the EPanel and GPanel tools, not all panel decals will have suitable backups, which is why there is now a dedicated Panel Cut tool. GPanel & EPanel With 1.9, GPanel is now fully documented, and EPanel has received a number of updates! More Check out the updates to the Re-Apply , Match Material , Select and Insert tools. Have a look at the changes to panels and the texture storage option. And finally, try the Initialize Generated Coords tool, as well as the Clear Decal Props and Remove Decal Orphans utils. 1.8.7 This is a significant release and represents the latest state of DECALmachine. It is in essence the 1.9 release, but without the main feature of it - the Baking of Decals. I think it's best I finish documentation first, before this is released. I've also been working on a new tool called Panel Cutting recently, for which you will also have to wait just a bit longer. EPanel However, there are various additions, that did make it into this 1.8.7 release. Such as EPanel , a tool similar to GPanel but instead of creating Panel Decals from Grease Pencil, it creates them from edge selections, or objects made of only edges. In Edit Mesh mode, it is accessed from Blender's context menu(previously called the specials menu). With the 2.79 keymap, it's on the W key, whereas it's on the RMB with the new industry default keymap. In Object mode, it is used like the Slice tool, where a target object is selected in addition to the edge-only object and called from the pie menu . UI changes The debug panel has been removed, and the Validate and Fix Texture Paths tools have been moved to the main DECALmachine panel. New tools, that are useful at times, but aren't as commonly used like the ones in the pie menu have also been added to the main DECALmachine panel. There is RemoveDecalOrphans , ClearDecalProps as well as the InitGeneratedUVs tool. Refer to their tooltips for descriptions, until proper documentation arrives with the 1.9 release. Decal Creation Batch Decal Creation is now supported when creating Info Decals from images. It's as simple as loading multiple images and ticking the All source images at once checkbox. The resulting instant decals will be laid out next to each other and can then be immediately added to a library using the Add to Library tool - also all at once. * with multiple images loaded, batch creation can be enabled* Decal Creation now also works in local view. In addition an issue with the Flatten Normals option, when used on meshes with existing custom normals has been fixed. Originally, normal maps baked for Decal Creation, were also baked to 16bit floating point normals for this release, improving their quality. However, this has been postponed till 2.0 now to investigate an issue with supersampling/anti aliasing. Improvements Re-Apply will now properly match the Material and Material 2 components of panel decal materials, when positioned accordingly across 2 supported materials. An issue when reapplying already projected decals to match their materials has been fixed. The Match tool now has visual indicators to help you identify which side of a panel decal is the Material side and which one is the Material 2 side. In addition to Blender's None/White Material, you can now also match DECALmachine's Default/Metal material - without it being present in the scene. Panel Decal Indicators of the Match* tool When changing the type/material of a panel decal using the Adjust tool, previous material matches and manual changes, will now be maintained. The cursor wrapping, when reaching the region boundary, has been improved as well. The Project and Slice tool, will now properly clear custom normals, when projected/sliced on meshes that have them. The default behavior of setting up surface snapping when bringing a decal into the scene, can now be disabled in the main DECALmachine panel. Blender recently introduced backface culling for Eevee materials. This is now enforced for decal materials, to avoid flipped decals going unnoticed. If you use BoxCutter and want to access DECALmachine's pie menu while the BoxCutter tool is active, you can do that now - as long you you remap either BoxCutter's or DECALmachine's pie menu away from D , as described here here. Crash Fix Last but not least, there was a crash when using GPanel with the Redo Panel , which has now been fixed. 1.8.5 This is a hotfix for Decal Creation. Height map creation and instant decal insertion from the panel were broken due to the recent depsgraph changes. 1.8.4 This is a hotfix for the Slice tool, which as a result of the recent depsgraph changes, didn't clear the panel decal material slots properly anymore, which in some circumstances could lead to invisible panel decals. 1.8.3 This is another unplanned release, but necessary due to depsgraph changes in Blender. Raycast behavior has been improved as well, and raycast performance was increased, which should be epecially noticable in bigger scenes. Attention There are some issues with how decal normal maps are rendered right now, at the time of release, May 18th. The issue is supposedly fixed already , but likely won't be available on build bot releases until May 19th. 1.8.2 This is an unplanned release, but necessary because rB8f71a84496a9 breaks Material Matching and with it the Re-Apply tool and Decal Insertion. To fix the issue introduced in that commit, DECALmachine will just ignore the Alpha and Emission parameters of the Princibled PBR shader node for now. So, both of these are not material matched . To properly support those material inputs, all decal assets will need to be updated, which is much more involded and will be done for the 1.9 release. GPanel GPanel was supposed to go into 1.9 as well, but I've decided to release it early now - and without full documentation. It may need some more testing and work, so be warned. Gpanel creates panel decals from grease pencil strokes. To use it, take the Grease Pencil and lay down strokes on the surface of a mesh object. The Line shape of the Grease pencil tool is very handy and I recommend you use that. Note however, that - for me at least - it has a tendency to crash Blender. Leave gaps between each stroke and be aware of the order and direction you draw the strokes in. Panel decals will be created based on that order. When done, you can use the Grease Pencil Sculpt tool with SHIFT pressed to smooth out the spaces. After that, go into object mode and choose GPanel from the DECALmachine pie menu. You can hold down SHIFT or CTRL to modiy is behavior. By default no connections are made, but with SHIFT the gaps between strokes are closed. With CTRL you make the panel decal cyclic. You can optionally also set these options in the Redo Panel . You can also set the segments for the connections there. GPanel always works on the active Grease Pencil layer and will hide a layer, once a panel decal is created from it. PIL From this version forward, DECALmachine will install PIL 6.0.0. If you have installed the previosu 5.4.1 already, no action is required on your part, 5.4.1 works just fine. If you want, you can purge your existing PIL installation from the DECALmachine preferences and install the new one, but it's completely optional. The installation process has been improved and will now remove any PIL found in the modules folder. There were a few people who attemted to install PIL like it was done in the 1.4 era: by moving a pre-compiled PIL into the modules folder. Besides being error prone, this will also interfere with how PIL is loaded now (from the user folder). Fixes In addtion to the material matching fix above, there has been a raycasting fix, where decals wouldn't align properly to modifier geometry. This was due to a bug introduced in Blender a813e259d630 https://developer.blender.org/rBa813e259d630), shortly before the initial 1.8 release. 1.8.1 Changes This update fixes a few issues that came up over the past 2 weeks. It includes a workaround for an open Blender bug affecting the Unwrap tool. Furthermore it adds an optional, automatic update check, letting you know in the pie menu, if a new version is available. Check out the changelog for details. FAQ additions Two new common questions have been added to the FAQ: Why can't I access DECALmachine's pie menu when I activate BoxCutter's tool? Why are my panel decal materials/textures taken from the Aircraft(or any other) library? 1.8 Simpler and more efficient, easier to use and more powerful. This describes DECALmachine 1.8 in a single sentence, and I hope you will agree. 1.8 being a fresh start and completely rewritten, really should be be 2.0, but I'm holding that back, until I get to feature parity with 1.4.2. That doesn't mean, that 1.8 is inferior. On the contrary: everything you need to work with Decals and to create Decals is here, and it's all far better, easier to use and more robust than before. Coupled with Blender's own advances like Eevee and Collections, DECALmachine 1.8 is a completely new experience. 1.9 and 2.0 will bring back baking of decals to a texture, as well as exporting decals via atlas creation. I've put considerable work into getting rid of a major pain point in the past: the installation of the infamous PIL module . Beta tests showed promise, that this is now solved for good, and for all 3 platforms, via an automated installation process, including two fallback installation methods. For the times when help is needed, there is now a help panel and a Request Support tool, streamlining the process and ensuring necessary information like log files is submitted with the first email. Also, all feature videos in the documentation now have voice-overs. I want to thank everyone who has supported my work in the past. All of this is only possible through your contributions. Enjoy 2.80! Check out the trailer , and feature videos to get up to speed. 1.4.2 This release fixes a number of issues, improves and refines many existing tools as well as adds 2 major new tools. Reconstruct Panel Cutter There's Reconstruct Panel Cutter , which takes an all-quad panel decal and builds a cutter from it. Unlike the Extract Source tool, which brings back cutting objects used for Topo Slice and Float Slice, Reconstruct Panel Cutter also works for panels created via Draw Slice, for manually built panel decals or for panel decals joined from a number of other (simpler) panels. Reconstruct Panel Cutter's resulting mesh will perfectly match your panel decal and can then be used for Material Cutting or Material Decaling . Surface Fix There's also Surface Fix , which can be used to remove unwanted shading artifacts. This is achieved by maintaining a separate surface source mesh(similar to how WStep maintains a separate normal_src mesh) and transferring its normal information to vertices masked by a vertex group. Improvements There's a few minor new tools such as Edit/Commit Normal Source and Edit/Commit Surface Fix , which can come in handy when working with WStep and Surface Fix. There's also an Unlink tool - for now only accessible via the space bar menu - which can quicky stash an object away without cluttering the scene, to be used as normal source meshes for either WStep or Surface fix. The base material used by Init Base Material , is now customizable in the DECALmachine preferences . Extract Source , now has an option to remove the decal you are extracting the source from. This can save some clicks and avoids tricky selections. Furthermore, Extract Source now automatically unparents the extracted source. Wstep has been extended and allows choosing the mapping method used in the DataTransfer mod. There's also a new option to allow hard edges, which creates a secondary DataTransfer mod and masks it using a vertex group. Material Cut has been improved to include a threshold value, used to merge duplicate vertices. By default, Material Cut marks edges as seams. While this is great to separate out areas that are to receive different materials, it will also influence how UVs are laid out and force separate UV islands. To circumvent this, you can now mark Material Cut edges as Freestyle edges. This is just to mark them, and make it easy to select them later. There's two new tools called \"Convert Freestyle to Seam\" and \"Convert Seam to Freestyle\" accessed via the spacebar menu, to manually convert one into the other. Also, the Unity, Unreal and Unpacked export targets support treating Freestyle edges as material seams, without manually converting them. Rotate Decal now has an axis option, which can be useful in some situations. Resources Most of the supplied info decal textures have been inverted to be white instead of black and so the invert slider in the info decal materials is now 0 by default. Textures for decals02-32 - decals02-37 have been replaced with higher quality versions. MACHIN3shaders(for the unity export) now include a \"Blend Surface Normals\" parameter, which mixes normals of the materials under the decals with the decal normals. This works perfectly for Info Decals. It's a hack for the other ones, but can produce good enough results. The Transparency parameter in the info Decal shader has been renamed to Opacity. Curvature channels in the ao_curv_height maps of supplied panel decals has been improved or re-added. This was intionally removed initially to improve visual integration in Cycles. However it turns out it's really useful to have, if you want to bake it down to control weathering in Substance Painter or Unity. Export A 'Combine all-to-one' option has been added to the DECALBakeDown export target. It overrides per-material-bake-combinations and instead combines bakes of all/selected export groups to one texture set. The Unity, UE4 and Unpacked export targets have received a \"Assign Unique Materials\" export option. This creates unique material IDs based on edge seams found on the model. This means you don't have to manually assign materials to areas they are supposed to receive unique materials before exporting. Assign Unique Materials is also available as a tool called form the spacebar menu. Run it on any mesh that has edges marked as seams. There's a new 'Create DM_non-decals group' option in the DECALexport pie. This is for pure convenience and can be helpful managing your export groups, decals and non-decals when preparing for export. The default atlas padding value used when packing a new decal atlas has been exposed and can be set in DECALmachine's preferences . Fixes There's been a number of fixes. See the changelog for details. 1.4.1 PBR Decals 1.4.1. started out as the second bugfix release for 1.4, but the 2.79 Blender release caught me by surprise and I was forced to implement some things originally intended for the 1.5 release. While Blender 2.78 is still supported, I'd generally advice anybody to switch to 2.79 now. With the Principled BSDF shader being a central part of 2.79, DECALmachine needs to support Material Matching it and so needs to have PBR decals. To achieve this the Match Material tool has been rebuilt from the ground up. It's extremely robust now and supports matching the Principled BSDF shader in addition to the Glossy shader. Operator properties have been added to modify its behavior and allow matching of either the Material part of a Subset Decal or the Subset part, or both at the same time. Similarly, both sides of a Panel Decal can be matched like this. Furthermore, if the target object carries multiple Materials, perhaps as a result of Material Cutting, each of the materials can be matched by stepping through the Material Slot parameter in the operator properties. Any new decals created in 1.4.1 via either Instant or Batch Decal Creation in Blender 2.79, will be switched to be PBR decals. Init Base Material will now also create a PBR base material, assuming it's run in Blender 2.79 As a consequence of improving the Match Material tool, the old Get and Set Material tools could be completely removed, as they've become obsolete and redundant. Update Decal Nodes To deal with scenes created before 2.79 and 1.4.1, there's a Update Decal Nodes tool, which you can call from the spacebar menu. This will update all existing decal materials in a scene to support PBR shaders. This tool is also automatically run on new Decals being inserted into a scene from the Asset Loaders, as any Decals created before 1.4.1 naturally don't support the Principled BSDF shader and so need to be updated. Changes and Improvements Filmic was supported before, but was not native to Blender. Now it is and DECALmachine has added support for it. The Topo Slice tool now has a twist offset parameter, which can be useful if a panel strip's boundary edge loops don't line up properly. Panel Transition has been improved and is much more robust now. The triangulation method for DECALexport has been changed from BEAUTY to FIXED, which seems to resemble the viewport/opengl triangulation and so should avoid unwanted surface intersections after exporting. The HOps Fix is now a part of HardOps itself making awkward code injections a thing of the past. As a result any Operatives should make sure to update to 'Hard Ops 0093 - Neptunium' before running DECALmachine 1.4.1. Fixes An export group related issue with decals projected on material decals has been fixed. Note that Material Decals should not be exported anyways, cut them into the mesh using Material Cut instead! The Remove Decal Mode didn't properly clean the open scene of panel decal assets, this is fixed now. A number of people experienced problems with the Rotate Decal option not working on the slice tools. This was related to them not having selection sync enabled in the UV editor, which now happens automatically. This also caused the Rotate Decal tool to not properly work, when run from edit mode. The mesh.intersect tool in Blender has been changed in 2.79, which caused the Material Cut and Panel Transition tools to fail. Both are working great with the 1.4.1 update. Decal and CustomDecal asset paths will no longer resist changes to a custom locations. Previously (W)Step would throw an exception, if it encountered empty material slots. A safety check has been added to prevent this. 1.4 Complete Decal Export Pipeline DECALmachine 1.4 is a huge release and the center piece of this update is the export capability. This turns DM from a mere Blender addon, into a complete pipeline for mesh based decals: experiment, create, design in Blender, but then also get your work out into a number of target platforms, if you so choose. In addition to the ability to export decals, there's also (W)Step - a tool/workflow to easily create custom vertex normals, which complement the decal workflow beautifully and are used to control hard surface shading without the need for normal maps. Note, it's highly recommended to use (W)Step along side HardOps and its boolean tools. If you are taking your assets into Unity3D, DM even supplies shaders specifically made to be used with the DM exported decals - it's the whole nine yards. But it doesn't stop there. The added ability to bake decal textures down into normal maps, ao maps, curvature maps, etc., unlocks a new approach to hard surface texturing, that could augment and in some scenarios perhaps even replace the traditional high-poly to low-poly workflow. So, how does this all work? The first step in the export process is the creation of an optimally packed Decal Atlas from individual decal textures. This is in essence completely automated, but does allow for some user input, in that you have the ability to change the scale of individual decals in the atlas as well as adjust the padding between them. Alternatively, instead of creating a new Atlas pack for each new asset, you can also use an existing packing solution you've created previously. The second step is organizing Decals and their parent objects(called targets ) via so called Export Groups . With this in place, decals will be joined, decal UVs will be adjusted according to the atlas packing solution and materials using the atlas textures will be applied - all automatically. Finally, your complete asset(incl. mesh decals) can be either exported to a number of platforms - such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine 4, Substance Painter and Sketchfab - or decals can be baked down, creating texture maps, that can be taken into any tool or engine you choose. Expanding the Slice Toolset 1.4 introduces an alternative Slice tool called Float Slice , useful in circumstances were the old Decal Slice - renamed to Topo Slice - has trouble or would fail, particularly on dense meshes. There's also Draw Slice which is a precursor tool to Float Slice and enables you to manually draw panel strips, by extruding vertices on the surface of an object. Concluding the additions to the slice tools is the Panelize tool, which makes adding simple decal strip shapes quick and effortless by turning polygon boundaries into panel strips, instead of the boolean-like approach of intersecting an object with a cutting object. Improving Usability Operator Properties This release adds Operator Properties for the main tools. This makes using DM more interactive, simplifies dealing with unexpected behavior(such as Topo Slice failing) and allows for a greater degree of customizing each tools behavior. Operator Properties can be accessed from the bottom of the T panel or by bringing up the F6 menu. Automatic Parenting of Projections and Slices If you project a decal or create a panel strip via one of the Slice tools, the decals will - by default - be parented to the object you project them on or the object you are slicing. This extends to the Decal Sources as well. So, when you change your objects location, orientation or scale and attempt to bring back a Decal Source , it will be properly positioned, just where you'd expect it to be. Keymap Settings to Preferences Changing DM's keymaps is now extremely easy and can be done directly in DECALmachine's preferences . In addition, all the GPencil tools can now be accessed via CTRL + D , so there's no longer any keymap overlap between DM and GPencil. Scene Scale/Unit Settings support There is a new setting called Force Consistent Scale in DM's preferences, which you should enable, if have experienced very small or big decals when dropping them into a scene in relation to your unit scale settings. Remove Decal Mode You can now delete decals] from inside Blender, without having to navigate to the Decal Library locations on your hard disk. Various Improvements Most tools have received small improvements and refinements in their behavior. Standing out from this is Material Cut which is now much more robust and has received Operator Properties to customize the behavior. Windows 32bit support Windows 32bit support through PILwin32.zip has been added thanks to Jordan. Fixes Decal Project and through Panel Unwrap the Slice tools will now remove any pre-existing UVs before creating new ones to avoid potential issues. The main DECALmachine pie menu is from now on keymaped only in Object and Edit modes instead of generally in all 3D Views, freeing the D shortcut for all other modes, such as Sculpt and Paint modes. An issue where non-tangent base normals would be created when running Instant Decal Creation has been fixed. Another issue related to hidden geometry causing very dark AO maps has also been resolved. Furthermore, Remove Duplicates could in some cases replace custom decal materials with their supplied decals counter parts and was fixed. Finally, split panel decal strips causing Panel Transition to fail was rectified. HardOps and MACHIN3tools If you use HardOps alongside DECALmachine, you should run the HardOps Fix in DECALmachine's preferences.md#general). Furthermore, I'd recommend you use at least some of the tools provided by MACHIN3tools , which is a free continuously evolving collection of scripts. In particular, Mirrror and Shading Switch are particularly useful in combination with DECALmachine and highly suggest you use Red Mode , should you use DECALmachine's custom vertex normal tool (W)Step . Mirror is the recommended way to mirror Decals across another object. If you are using Rob Fornof's Mirror Mirror and/or my previous Multi Mirror Mirror , Mirror replaces them both.","title":"What's new?"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"whatsnew.html#2142","text":"2025-06-07 Second bug fix release, mostly in regards to the UV Transfer tool, but also addressing some issues in Blender 4.5 still in beta! .

Note Raising the minimum version to Blender 4.2, allowed me to update the supplied Example assets , so they are now ready-to-use in 4.2, after installation.

Blender 4.2 and with it DECALmachine 2.12 is no different. The asset update is easy, and has been made very robust over the previous releases. Once the decal and trim sheet libraries themselves have been updated, any existing .blend files using decals and trimsheets made with a previous version should be updated too, especially if you plan to continue working in them. Note that with Blender 4.2 in particular, opening legacy blend files may result in black decals, because Blender automatically adds somes additional nodes, which I don't think work quite as intended.

The Slice , GPanel , Epanel and Adjust tools are affected by this, as they try to directly import the Panel Decal material (by name).

It supports appending decal materials, that have previously been saved incorrectly. This way, no addtional update of already-updated Decals is necessary. Just install this bugfix version of DECALmachine, and they will work as you'd expect. To do the update - and IF you are updating from 2.11.0 - I can now recommend, that you use the new Integrated Updater , introduced in DECALmachine 2.11.0.

This can be further automated in future, but for now it's done manually using the Transfer UVs tool.","title":"Transferring UVs/Textures aka Texture Matching"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#assets","text":"Longtime DECALmachine user and contributer of the DECALmachine 1.8 promo image varzov has released a massive city scape kitbash set, great stuff!","title":"Assets"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#tutorials","text":"After her excellent decal pack, Carol Sung is back with a fantastic tutorial covering HardOps, BoxCuttter, MESHmachine, DECALmachine and MACHIN3tools, check it out!","title":"Tutorials"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#my-god-its-full-of-decals","text":"There have been quite a number of decal packs released since the DECALmachine 2.3 release!

The default behavior of setting up surface snapping when bringing a decal into the scene, can now be disabled in the main DECALmachine panel. Blender recently introduced backface culling for Eevee materials. This is now enforced for decal materials, to avoid flipped decals going unnoticed.

It may need some more testing and work, so be warned. Gpanel creates panel decals from grease pencil strokes. To use it, take the Grease Pencil and lay down strokes on the surface of a mesh object. The Line shape of the Grease pencil tool is very handy and I recommend you use that. Note however, that - for me at least - it has a tendency to crash Blender. Leave gaps between each stroke and be aware of the order and direction you draw the strokes in. Panel decals will be created based on that order. When done, you can use the Grease Pencil Sculpt tool with SHIFT pressed to smooth out the spaces. After that, go into object mode and choose GPanel from the DECALmachine pie menu. You can hold down SHIFT or CTRL to modiy is behavior. By default no connections are made, but with SHIFT the gaps between strokes are closed. With CTRL you make the panel decal cyclic. You can optionally also set these options in the Redo Panel . You can also set the segments for the connections there.

This describes DECALmachine 1.8 in a single sentence, and I hope you will agree. 1.8 being a fresh start and completely rewritten, really should be be 2.0, but I'm holding that back, until I get to feature parity with 1.4.2. That doesn't mean, that 1.8 is inferior. On the contrary: everything you need to work with Decals and to create Decals is here, and it's all far better, easier to use and more robust than before. Coupled with Blender's own advances like Eevee and Collections, DECALmachine 1.8 is a completely new experience. 1.9 and 2.0 will bring back baking of decals to a texture, as well as exporting decals via atlas creation. I've put considerable work into getting rid of a major pain point in the past: the installation of the infamous PIL module . Beta tests showed promise, that this is now solved for good, and for all 3 platforms, via an automated installation process, including two fallback installation methods. For the times when help is needed, there is now a help panel and a Request Support tool, streamlining the process and ensuring necessary information like log files is submitted with the first email.

There's also an Unlink tool - for now only accessible via the space bar menu - which can quicky stash an object away without cluttering the scene, to be used as normal source meshes for either WStep or Surface fix. The base material used by Init Base Material , is now customizable in the DECALmachine preferences . Extract Source , now has an option to remove the decal you are extracting the source from. This can save some clicks and avoids tricky selections. Furthermore, Extract Source now automatically unparents the extracted source. Wstep has been extended and allows choosing the mapping method used in the DataTransfer mod. There's also a new option to allow hard edges, which creates a secondary DataTransfer mod and masks it using a vertex group. Material Cut has been improved to include a threshold value, used to merge duplicate vertices. By default, Material Cut marks edges as seams. While this is great to separate out areas that are to receive different materials, it will also influence how UVs are laid out and force separate UV islands. To circumvent this, you can now mark Material Cut edges as Freestyle edges. This is just to mark them, and make it easy to select them later. There's two new tools called \"Convert Freestyle to Seam\" and \"Convert Seam to Freestyle\" accessed via the spacebar menu, to manually convert one into the other. Also, the Unity, Unreal and Unpacked export targets support treating Freestyle edges as material seams, without manually converting them.

Textures for decals02-32 - decals02-37 have been replaced with higher quality versions. MACHIN3shaders(for the unity export) now include a \"Blend Surface Normals\" parameter, which mixes normals of the materials under the decals with the decal normals. This works perfectly for Info Decals. It's a hack for the other ones, but can produce good enough results. The Transparency parameter in the info Decal shader has been renamed to Opacity. Curvature channels in the ao_curv_height maps of supplied panel decals has been improved or re-added. This was intionally removed initially to improve visual integration in Cycles. However it turns out it's really useful to have, if you want to bake it down to control weathering in Substance Painter or Unity.","title":"Resources"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#export","text":"A 'Combine all-to-one' option has been added to the DECALBakeDown export target. It overrides per-material-bake-combinations and instead combines bakes of all/selected export groups to one texture set. The Unity, UE4 and Unpacked export targets have received a \"Assign Unique Materials\" export option. This creates unique material IDs based on edge seams found on the model. This means you don't have to manually assign materials to areas they are supposed to receive unique materials before exporting. Assign Unique Materials is also available as a tool called form the spacebar menu. Run it on any mesh that has edges marked as seams. There's a new 'Create DM_non-decals group' option in the DECALexport pie. This is for pure convenience and can be helpful managing your export groups, decals and non-decals when preparing for export. The default atlas padding value used when packing a new decal atlas has been exposed and can be set in DECALmachine's preferences .","title":"Export"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#fixes_1","text":"There's been a number of fixes. See the changelog for details.","title":"Fixes"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#141","text":"","title":"1.4.1"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#pbr-decals","text":"1.4.1. started out as the second bugfix release for 1.4, but the 2.79 Blender release caught me by surprise and I was forced to implement some things originally intended for the 1.5 release. While Blender 2.78 is still supported, I'd generally advice anybody to switch to 2.79 now. With the Principled BSDF shader being a central part of 2.79, DECALmachine needs to support Material Matching it and so needs to have PBR decals. To achieve this the Match Material tool has been rebuilt from the ground up. It's extremely robust now and supports matching the Principled BSDF shader in addition to the Glossy shader. Operator properties have been added to modify its behavior and allow matching of either the Material part of a Subset Decal or the Subset part, or both at the same time. Similarly, both sides of a Panel Decal can be matched like this. Furthermore, if the target object carries multiple Materials, perhaps as a result of Material Cutting, each of the materials can be matched by stepping through the Material Slot parameter in the operator properties. Any new decals created in 1.4.1 via either Instant or Batch Decal Creation in Blender 2.79, will be switched to be PBR decals. Init Base Material will now also create a PBR base material, assuming it's run in Blender 2.79 As a consequence of improving the Match Material tool, the old Get and Set Material tools could be completely removed, as they've become obsolete and redundant.","title":"PBR Decals"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#update-decal-nodes","text":"To deal with scenes created before 2.79 and 1.4.1, there's a Update Decal Nodes tool, which you can call from the spacebar menu. This will update all existing decal materials in a scene to support PBR shaders. This tool is also automatically run on new Decals being inserted into a scene from the Asset Loaders, as any Decals created before 1.4.1 naturally don't support the Principled BSDF shader and so need to be updated.","title":"Update Decal Nodes"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#changes-and-improvements","text":"Filmic was supported before, but was not native to Blender. Now it is and DECALmachine has added support for it. The Topo Slice tool now has a twist offset parameter, which can be useful if a panel strip's boundary edge loops don't line up properly. Panel Transition has been improved and is much more robust now. The triangulation method for DECALexport has been changed from BEAUTY to FIXED, which seems to resemble the viewport/opengl triangulation and so should avoid unwanted surface intersections after exporting. The HOps Fix is now a part of HardOps itself making awkward code injections a thing of the past. As a result any Operatives should make sure to update to 'Hard Ops 0093 - Neptunium' before running DECALmachine 1.4.1.","title":"Changes and Improvements"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#fixes_2","text":"An export group related issue with decals projected on material decals has been fixed. Note that Material Decals should not be exported anyways, cut them into the mesh using Material Cut instead! The Remove Decal Mode didn't properly clean the open scene of panel decal assets, this is fixed now. A number of people experienced problems with the Rotate Decal option not working on the slice tools. This was related to them not having selection sync enabled in the UV editor, which now happens automatically. This also caused the Rotate Decal tool to not properly work, when run from edit mode. The mesh.intersect tool in Blender has been changed in 2.79, which caused the Material Cut and Panel Transition tools to fail. Both are working great with the 1.4.1 update. Decal and CustomDecal asset paths will no longer resist changes to a custom locations. Previously (W)Step would throw an exception, if it encountered empty material slots. A safety check has been added to prevent this.","title":"Fixes"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#14","text":"","title":"1.4"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#complete-decal-export-pipeline","text":"DECALmachine 1.4 is a huge release and the center piece of this update is the export capability. This turns DM from a mere Blender addon, into a complete pipeline for mesh based decals: experiment, create, design in Blender, but then also get your work out into a number of target platforms, if you so choose. In addition to the ability to export decals, there's also (W)Step - a tool/workflow to easily create custom vertex normals, which complement the decal workflow beautifully and are used to control hard surface shading without the need for normal maps. Note, it's highly recommended to use (W)Step along side HardOps and its boolean tools. If you are taking your assets into Unity3D, DM even supplies shaders specifically made to be used with the DM exported decals - it's the whole nine yards. But it doesn't stop there. The added ability to bake decal textures down into normal maps, ao maps, curvature maps, etc., unlocks a new approach to hard surface texturing, that could augment and in some scenarios perhaps even replace the traditional high-poly to low-poly workflow. So, how does this all work? The first step in the export process is the creation of an optimally packed Decal Atlas from individual decal textures. This is in essence completely automated, but does allow for some user input, in that you have the ability to change the scale of individual decals in the atlas as well as adjust the padding between them. Alternatively, instead of creating a new Atlas pack for each new asset, you can also use an existing packing solution you've created previously. The second step is organizing Decals and their parent objects(called targets ) via so called Export Groups . With this in place, decals will be joined, decal UVs will be adjusted according to the atlas packing solution and materials using the atlas textures will be applied - all automatically. Finally, your complete asset(incl. mesh decals) can be either exported to a number of platforms - such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine 4, Substance Painter and Sketchfab - or decals can be baked down, creating texture maps, that can be taken into any tool or engine you choose.","title":"Complete Decal Export Pipeline"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#expanding-the-slice-toolset","text":"1.4 introduces an alternative Slice tool called Float Slice , useful in circumstances were the old Decal Slice - renamed to Topo Slice - has trouble or would fail, particularly on dense meshes.
