			- by default both - location and rotation - are set now, either from the cursor or another object
				- use `ALT` or `CTR` mod keys, or redo panel to set only rotation, or only location
			- NOTE: since Blender only supports a translation offset for instance collections, assembly origin orientation is changed, by manipulating instance collection root object locations and rotations within the collection
			
	- UpdateThumbnail tool
		- add Thumbnail Helper Gizmo to fine-tune automatic framing
			- NOTE: framing of the thumbnail is internally based on bbox(es)
				- but they may not represent the ideal or desired space the asset should occupy within a thumbnail
				- so the helper gizmo will overwrite the asset's bbox

		- support assembly/asset creation without duplication (enable in addon prefs)
		- support adding tags and meta data
		- base average assembly origin location on non-wire objects preferably
		- improve main *_Assembly* collection creation (previously called *_Assets*), and support multiple (per-scene) across a single blend file

		- with a single asset browser open at time of asset creation select 'All' pseudo catalog in 'Current File' library
		
	- add ResetAssemblyOrigin tool 
		- zero out collection's `instance_offset` and compensate collection objects accordingly
		 	- this ensures the assembly's origin is exactly in the world origin within the instance collection
		- support user made instance collections too
		
	- add CleanNonAssets tool 
		- used to prepare a file for saving in an asset library, avoiding file bloat
		- removes everything in a blend file that is not an asset or related to one

* Group tools
	- support drawing group relationships
		- draw group origins and distinguish between active and other groups by color

		- significantly flesh out Group Mode (toggled via `1` key by default)
			- indicate if you are in group mode via red label in outliner header
			- automatically toggle group relationship drawing
			- improve outliner layout changes and restoration of initial state when entering/leaving group mode
			- by default - when entering group mode - disable auto select, recursive select and group empty hiding
				- disabling auto select in particular, helps manually changing group hierarchies by dragging group empties around in the outliner, and avoids unindented hierarchy changes
				- automatically respond to those changes and update internal group properties accordingly, so there is no more need to run the Group Select tool afterwards
			- avoid applying outliner *filter_text*, when there are no other empties but group empties or when group prefixes or suffixes are not actually used

	- draw fading label when setting one of the presets indicating the curretn snap target and snap element(s)
	- use CLOSEST target for absolute grid snapping
	- enable snap_show_absolute_grid prefs by default now

* Shading pie
  - expose rotation, if mapping node is connected to image node, which in turn is connected to the background node

	- fix exception for world setup using background node with connected image texture

	- when detecting a trace_max_roughness of 0 while raytracing is enabled, reset it to its default of 0.5
     - opening up pre-4.2 files seems to set this value to 0, but with it at 0, all metals will look like plastic
 	 	 - print warning message to terminal when doing this

	- fix angle prop not being in degrees when replacing invalid auto smooth
		- also recreate show_expanded and use_pin_to_last props

  - remove some legacy prefs that are no longer used


# 1.10.1
> 2024-08-05

* AssetBrowser tools
	- rework MakeLocal tool completely
		- fix issues on more complex linked assets of assets, and sometimes even on simple linked assets
		- making objects (instance collection or not) is tiered
			- by default, if the selected object is linked, only the object itself will be made local
				- this allows you to position, scale, and rotate the object, while its data or linked instance collection remain linked, and so only exist in an external file)
			- only on the second run, or when holding down `SHIFT`, or when the object itself is not linked and only its data or instance collection be made local too
		- instance collections are only ever made local one level down
			- so for recursive linked instance collections, you could keep the lower level linked while making the upper level local or disassemble it
		
	- CreateAssemblyAsset tool
		- fix occasional black thumbnails
		- fix exception, when not unlinking empty

	- DisassembleAssembly tool
		- use new logic from MakeLocal to ensure linked assemblies are made local properly

* Save pie
	- add ReloadLibraries tool, when linked data blocks are used

* Modes pie
	- improve handling of linked or partially linked objects by detecting if object data or instance collection is linked, even if object itself is not linked (anymore)

* Group tool
	- add workaround for Blender 4.2 "object loses transform bug on redo" bug

* Cursor and Origin pie
	- OriginToBottomBounds tool
		- add workaround for Blender 4.2 "object loses transform bug on redo" bug

* CreateDoFEmpty (Prime only)
	- fix exception when drawing fading label

* SmartEdge tool
	- fix issue in Korean Bevel mode

* remove unnecessary imports all over


# 1.10
> 2024-08-01

* AssetBrowser tools
  - CreateAssemblyAsset tool
    - rework completely and massively simplify the UX and exposed options
      - always duplicate the original objects for use in the instance collection
        - and always removed MM stashes and DM backups on those duplicates
      - avoid moving instance collection objects into world origin, make use of `instance_offset` instead
      - always add asset collection to the viewlayer in the main *_Assets* collection, which itself is on, but excluded from the view layer
        - this aims to make things more transparent, and so you now can easily see which asset collections exist in the file
      - by default, unlink the asset empty, so the asset only appears in the AssetBrowser's LOCAL/Current File library
        - if disabled bring back an instance of it, offset in front of the original object(s)
    - redo thumbnail rendering too
      - perfectly frame the asset automatically, incl. recursive assets of assets
      - support camera view (incl. Depth of Field) and cycles rendering
    - support placing asset empty in Cursor location
  
  - add Disassemble tool
    - replaces previously awkwardly named AssembleInstanceCollection
    - make assembly asset/instance collection objects accessible
    - when assembly is linked, make it local
    - support Rigid Body setup if assembly objects are using it

  - add MakeLocal tool
    - makes assembly local without disassembling
    - unlike the native op it properly deals with only the selection, but also goes recursively over it to deal with linked assets of assets
      - whereas the native `make_local` would have to be run with the ALL argument, which would then affect ALL linked id types in the entire blend file

  - add RemoveAssemblyAsset tool
    - by default it removes the assembly empty + instance collection, if it no longer has any other users (such as other assemblies using the same instance collection) 
    - for local assets, it can optionalyl completely remove the entire asset and all instances of it from the file
      - naturally, this then removes it from the asset browser too
    - for legacy assets (those created with prior versions, that didn't duplicate the original objects yet) just disassemble the asset/assembly and let the user decide if the collection objects should be removed

  - add UpdateAssetThumbnail tool
    - can be called from the 3D view's sidebar simply by selecting any local assembly asset
    - or alternatively from thee asset browser's sidebar
      - here it requires selecting the asset itself, and any object in the 3D view
 
  - expose assembly asset collection name in asset browser's sidebar

  - AssetBrowser Bookmarks
    - add pseudo-bookmark for LOCAL (Current File) library
      - keymapped to `ALT + ^` by default
      - when using this, MACHIN3tools will auto size thumbnails based on asset browser dimensions
      - NOTE: it's not possible to set All or Unassigned catalogs from the API
        - so instead MACHIN3tools will select the most used catalog in the file to ensure something is shown at all
        - also note, that Blender doesn't even list catalogs that exist in a file, if that file is not stored in an asset library location

    - fix some issues where the wrong library and catalog where displayed in the header

* Material Picker tool
  - support multiple 3d views and asset browsers open at the same time
    - pick/assign from any 3d view or asset browser on the workspace
  - support picking from and assigning to FONT, SURFACE and META objects

* Filebrowser tools
  - fix opening active folder in system's file browser via `O`
  - support modal thumbnail size adjustment
    - just hold down the `3` and move the mouse horizontally
    - feel free to remap to `CTRL + MIDDLEMOUSÈ` click-drag, to mirror Blender native panel scaling
    - you can disable this in addon preferences for legacy-style thumbnail size cycling using `3` and `ALT + 3` accordingly

* Group tools
  - Outliner Group mode toggle (via `1` key)
    - when group auto-naming is enabled in addon preferences, further filter the outliner to consider the group prefix and/or suffix
       - this way you can truly only have group empties show up, instead of all empties

  - CreateGroup tool
    - when un-groupable (already parented) objects are among the selection, indicate that they weren't added to the group
       - also increase fading label time when there are un-groupable objects
  - redo/simplify group naming
  
  - Groupify tool
    - stop adding _GROUP to the empty names
    - support auto-naming addon pref
      - and with it disabled keep the original empty names accordingly

* Smart Edge tool
  - support connecting lose/non-manifold verts, thanks Artem!

* Align tool
  - add workaround in 4.2 for "object loses transform on redo" [bug](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/125335)

    - add bloom and dispersion toggles
      - both are setup and then toggled via realtime compositing
    - add Volume rendering toggle
      - with volume objects present, toggle volume object filtering in the viewport
      - without volume objects the world volume (node) is toggled, or created when there is none yet

# 1.9
> 2024-05-23

* MaterialPicker tool
  - add `RIGHTMOUSE` keymap
    - for now disabled by default, so please enable manually in addon prefs
    - if you use `RIGHTMOUSE` for the context menu, you can add a mod key in the MACHIN3tools keymap prefs for RMB-material-picking/assigning
    - I highly recommend you try this, IMO it's a game changer
  - the tool is only active on views that show materials: MATERIAL shading, RENDERED shading, and SOLID shading IF MATERIAL is chosen as the `color_type`
    - NOTE: in SOLID shading make use of the Colorize Materials tool in the Shading pie, if all your materials show as white
  - the tool existing in 3 *modes*: PICK, ASSIGN, ASSIGN_FROM_ASSETBROWSER
    - which one of these are available, depends on presence of material editor, asset browser, object or face selection
    - for instance, without a material editor or asset browser on the workspace, but with an object selection present, the tool will invoke into ASSIGN mode automatically
  - with an object or face selection present, support clearing materials using `X`
  - when appending material from assetbrowser attempt to set the material's viewport color
  - support assigning material from asset browser to entire object selection using `ALT`
    - as opposed to just the object the mouse is over via `LEFTMOUSE`
  - in the HUD
    - try to draw picked or to-be-assigned material's color under its name, fetched from the *Base Color* input of the last node
    - in object mode list objects that are to be assigned a material and lightly draw object wires
    - in edit mode indicate if material is to be assigned to face selection
  - fix button not appearing in RENDERED viewport (even though enabled in addon prefs)

* Filebrowser tools, Assetbrowser tools, AssetBrowser Bookmarks, Toggle Region tool
  - support asset browser `display_type` cycling + storage
    - NOTE: this is not natively exposed in the Blender UI, but internally the asset browser is still just a Filebrowser in Blender, and so the `display_type` can still be changed
    - cycle between display types:
      - THUMBNAIL
      - LIST_VERTICAL
      - LIST_HORIZONTAL
  - use the `2` key, just as in the Filebrowser (same keymap item in fact) for asset browser `display_type` cycling
  - use previously unused (in asset browser) `4` keymap to cycle asset import method now
  - also draw button to cycle through Assetbrowser `display_types` in asset browser header

* Shading pie
  - 4.1 Auto Smooth
    - expose and make the auto smooth angle accessible, even on meshes with custom normals
    - expose setting in addon prefs to keep Auto Smooth mod expanded in mod stack, not collapsed
    - if not found itn he file already, append *Smooth by Angle* nodegroup from ESSENTIALS lib, without relying native op
    - when opening the pie look for invalid auto smooth mod and remove it
      - Blender can *sometimes* create these, especially when pasting or appending objects from legacy files
      - terminal will complain about missing *Angle* or *Ignore Sharps* inputs in that case
  - in SOLID shading with MATERIAL `color_type` chosen, expose active object's active material's viewport color
   - support wireframe toggling and wireframe opacity adjustment in SCULPT mode
  - BevelShader setup
    - prevent exception when materials without node_tree are encounted, like Blender's Fur Material
  - Shade Smooth tool
    - update description to mention sharp edges are based on operator prop, not auto smooth angle any longer

* Modes pie
  - support EDIT_CURVES + SCULPT_CURVES modes
  - disable "SurfaceDraw"-pseudo-mode, use Annotate tools from tools pie instead!

* Tools pie
  - add annotate buttons at the bottom
  - remove out Hops/BC buttons, I don't think anybody uses the pie for these?
  - simplify HyperCursor / Select Box alternation
    - this now allows easy switching from HC to annotating, and back
    - avoid always force-enabling HC gizmos, when switching into HC tool too

* Workspace pie
  - add Geo Nodes workspace to bottom left

* SelectHierachy tool
  - support selecting geo nodes mod objects

* ToggleSmooth tool
  - use `SHIFT + TAB` as the default on Windows

* ApplyTransform tool
  - ensure object has data block, so transform can actually be applied

* addon preferences
  - mention Bevel Shader in Render tools description
    - it is exposed through the Shading pie, but enabled through the Render tools
  - add ResetKeymaps and RestoreKeymaps buttons in keymaps tab IF there are user modified keymaps or missingkeymaps (due to user removal, accidental or not)
  - improve how keymap items are drawn

* Customize tool
  - M3 theme
    - define compliant colors for Attribute Editor/Spreadsheet space
    - use fully transparent color for front-facing face orientation color
    - lower the alpha of the back-facing face orientation color (red)
  - overlays
    - when the M3 thme is being installed enable the face orientation overlays
  - startup file
    - set (annotate) stroke placement to SURFACE and set eraser size to 50px
  - keymaps
    - disable `node.select` keymappings in *Node Tool: Select Box* keymap
    - in 2.7x keymap
      - set `node.select` keymappings in *Node Editor* keymap from `RIGHTMOUSE` to `LEFGMOUSE` using `PRESS` events
      - this allows for additive and subtractive node selection using `SHIFT + LMB` without delay
  - system
    - enable experimental asset debug info


# 1.8
> 2024-03-22


## DeusEx

* SetupGroupGizmos tool
  - add option to lock axes, that don't carry a gizmo
    - this then allows for easy and lazy group rotation using the native op, without having to pick the right axis, and even with the rotation gizmo(s) disabled
    - disable locking via `R` or `L` keys


## Prime <sup>previously Standard</sup>

* Assetbrowser tools
  - add Assetbrowser Bookmarks

    - support jumping to library/catalog via new `ALT + 0` to `ALT + 0` keymaps
    - bookmarks store and recall library, catalog and thumbnail size
    - bookmarks are stored on disk in `assetbrowser_bookmarks.json` in Blender's config folder
  - with the catalog sidebar closed, display the library and catalog in the asset browser header
  - support maintaining bookmarks, across Library renames (Blender restart required)
  - NOTE: you can't bookmark any catalog in the 'Current File' library
    - and you can't bookmark any library's 'Unassigned' catalog either

* Shading pie
  - BevelShader
    - support toggling it per-object
    - add arrow buttons to increase or decrease the global or per-object radius
      - halve and double the curretn value by default
      - with SHIFT held down, do -25% or +33% instead for smaller adjustments
  - Smooth, Flat, ToggleAutoSmooth tools
    - redo them completely, and maintain the same look and UX in 4.1 as before
    - in Blender 4.1
      - support auto smooth toggling by adding/removing geo node mod
        - sort it at the end of the stack, but before mirror and array mods
        - support intanced objects
      - support Auto Smooth for CURVE objects
    - support SURFACE objects in object mode (Blender does too, so why not)
    - properly deal with hidden children and mod objects when in local view and when either or both are included in a Smooth or Flat shading operation
    - when shading Smooth, optionally (but by default) enable Auto Smooth for objects carrying boolean mods
    - when shading Smooth with `ALT` pressed, sharpen edges via new operator angle property, not via a mesh's auto smooth angle prop as before
    - when Flat shading with `ALT` pressed to clear sharps, seams, etc, also disable Auto Smooth, if enabled, or present
    - limit options, that are exposed in redo panel, depending on context, hide what doesn't apply
    - when Flat shading and removing creases, make option, that avoids removal of creases while subd mods with `use_crease` are present, work per-object not globally or entire selection
    - add object mode fading HUD summarizing the shading changes
  - display Clear Custom Normals op, independently of Auto Smooth being enabled in 4.1
    - neither custom normals nor sharp edges require Auto Smooth anymore

* MaterialPicker tool
  - support fetching materials from and assigning them to CURVE objects

* SelectHierarchy tool
  - indicate number of hidden parents/children in fading HUD

* Group Add/Remove tools
  - add little fading HUD to visually confirm what happened

    - allows for very easy addon update installation from .zip file, and from inside of Blender, instead of manually from the file browser
    - finds matching .zip file(s) in home and Downloads folder
    - allows selecting one of them them or manually selecting a file in any other location
    - extracts the file to a temporary location, and installs update when quitting Blender
    - like a manual update installation from the filebrowser, this maintains previous addon settings and custom keys
    - see installation instructions for details  

* Customize tool
  - tweak M3 theme
    - adjust to edit mode color changes in 4.1
    - make crease edges green
  - when customizing the startup file, while the Shading pie has been activated, disable native cursor display and activate custom cursor and object axes drawing instead
  - fix issues modifying keymap in 4.1
  - add hidden Toolbar Popup keymaps
    - set Annotate to D
    - set Annotate Erase to E
    - without deliberately creating these keymaps, the default keymaps will change depending on the active tool, now they are consistent
  - invert Transform Modal Map's proportional editing keymaps, so increasing the size is done by scrolling up and decreasing by scrolling down
