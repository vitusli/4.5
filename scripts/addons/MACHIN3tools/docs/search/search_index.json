It's aimed at streamlining common and mostly basic Blender tasks but also includes more advanced tools, in particular in the DeusEx variant . Unlike MESHmachine or DECALmachine , the toolset in MACHIN3tools is less focused on specifics like mesh-modeling in case or MESHmachine or detailing in case of DECALmachine, and could be seen more as an UI/UX layer on top of Blender, with a wide ranging set of tools and menus tackling various areas in Blender. The What's New? and Changelog pages are a great resource to get up to speed with the latest changes. The changelog is written extra verbose so as to serve as light documentation. Note The following video on version 0.3 is from the early stages 7 years ago, but should still serve as a good surface-layer introduction to MACHIN3tools. For details on specific tools and menus use the nav bar to the left or see the latest additions on the What's new? page. Prime or DeusEx? MACHIN3tools comes in two base variants - Prime and DeusEx . Prime already contains almost everything - measured in lines of code not the best way to do it! Prime is 85% of the DeusEx variant. But DeusEx contains a few more-advanced tools not present in the Prime variant. They are: the Edge Constrained Transform tool Group Gizmos and Poses the Punch It manifold Extrusion tool, similar to the one in the dedicated PUNCHit addon advanced Assembly/Asset tools like Assembly Editing, Assembly Variants, Assembly Origin Orientation/Rotation Adjustment, and more Purchase MACHIN3tools is sold on two markets: Gumroad Superhive formerly known as Blender Market Studio Versions Oh Gumroad there are Studio Versions for DeusEx available too, should you use MACHIN3tools in a company setting will multiple users.

MACHIN3tools 1.8 of MACHIN3tools also brought Assetbrowser Bookmarks , and 1.9 allows you cycling the display type just like in a filebrowser . MACHIN3tools 1.10 to 1.12 brought major updates, further improving working with assemblies, including within a single blend file, and not necessarily as external assets. Assembly Assets A core concept of the Assetbrowser tools are Assembly Assets , which are usually multi-object assets , that are organized into a collection, and referenced by an instance collection empty. This allows you to work with them as a single unified object or drop them into a scene from an external file via the Asset Browser, again as single unified asset. Assemblies can be optionally disassembled at any time, or in DeusEx directly edited . Menu 3DView > MACHIN3 tab > MACHIN3tools Panel > Assetbrowser Tools Save Pie Modes Pie Create and Disassemble Assemblies Note As of version 1.0.1, a thumbnail is assigned automatically to the asset and no longer needs to be added manually. As of version 1.1, individual asset's objects no longer need to be positioned in the world origin. Severely Hidden Objects Assembly Asset Creation supports severely hidden objects , which are objects in excluded or hidden collections. Decal Backups and Stash Objects DECALmachine backups or MESHmachine can now (again) also be kept around. These will persist after dropping an asset into a new file after disassembly or when editing an assembly. Skip Duplication You can optionally skip duplicating which creates the asset from the original objects. This has to be enabled in the addon preferences first. Note This is a bit more limited - for instance it doesn't support sub-assembly assets - and in my opinion is more suitable to simple assemblies, but it may suit your workflow better. Sub-Assembly Assets Sub-Assembly Assets are ones created from part of a larger hierarchy of objects, which is now supported via the Selection Only toggle in the Create Assembly Asset popup. Tags and Metadata To avoid repetitive tasks, you can now also add tags and metadata at time of asset creation. Metadata can be setup in the addon preferences Create Asset Thumbnails Thumbnail Helper Gizmo DeusEx only The DeusEx variant offers a Thumbnail Helper Gizmo, that gives precise control over the Asset's Thumbnail framing , which can sometimes be off a bit when done automatically, in particular with rotated mirrored objects present within the assembly. Assembly Editing DeusEx only DeusEx also allows you to directly introspect and edit any Assembly or Instance Collection. Set and Reset Assembly Origin The Assembly Origin is now set relative to the Assembly's empty object, but can optionally still be set relative to the original assembly objects. In addition you can now reset the origin, thereby making the instance collection empty the world origin within the collection. Assembly Origin Rotation/Orientation DeusEx only DeuxEx even allows you to change an assembly/instance collection origin's rotation or orientation now - something that Blender itself doesn't support directly, as the instance collection offset only affects translation. Set Assembly Origin from Cursor and Origin pie Instead of adjusting the Assembly Origin from the sidebar, you can now do it from the Cursor and Origin pie as well. Assembly Variants DeusEx only In DeusEx you can create Assembly Variants now, which are unique variations independent of existing assemblies. Turn Assembly into Asset DeusEx only Also in DeusEx - and particularly useful for Assembly Variants or also any user-created Instance Collection really - you can now easily turn them into a local asset with proper thumbnail, and optionally with tags and metadata. Note This is different from creating an entirely new assembly asset, as the active object is an assembly referencing a collection already. Asset Storage Finally, once you are happy and finished with your assets, you can then use the new Clean-out Non-Assets tool, which creates an efficiently small a blend file that contains only the assets and related data. Asset Bookmarks If you appreciate the Asset Browser, you will love Asset Browser Bookmarks. Bookmarks bar in Asset Browser header, and Library - Catalog shown next to it You can jump to any saved bookmark by clicking on it or by using the ALT + 1 to \u00c0LT + 0 keymaps. You can save any Library + Catalog combination by SHIFT clicking on a number/bookmark. Thumbnail size is saved too by the way. You can clear a bookmark by CTRL clicking on it. This is so convenient to use and gets even better in combination with the Toggle Region tool , which can pop an asset browser area open at the top and bottom of your 3D view at any time. The bookmarks bar is of course of less use in a vertical setup: However, the shortcuts to recall a bookmark still work without issue. So if you prefer to work like that, you will just have to temporarily widen the asset browser area, and save your bookmarks while you can see it, then shrink it down again. Local Library Bookmark Display Type With the Filebrowser tools active, you can now adjust the display_type in the Assetbrowser as well via the 2 key, again just like in the Filebrowser. You can also cycle the display_type using a dedicated button in the Assetbrowser header, which - again - is most suitable for horizontal layouts. Changing the display_type is recognized and remembered by the ToggleRegion tool, as well as when setting and recalling bookmarks .","title":"Assetbrowser Tools<sup>partly Deus Ex</sup>"},{"location":"assetbrowser_tools.html#asset-browser-tools","text":"The Asset Browser tools build on Blender's native Asset Browser and significantly enhance its functionality and general asset creation in Blender.

support setting assembly origin rotation now by default both - location and rotation - are set now, either from the cursor or another object use ALT or CTR mod keys, or redo panel to set only rotation, or only location NOTE: since Blender only supports a translation offset for instance collections, assembly origin orientation is changed, by manipulating instance collection root object locations and rotations within the collection UpdateThumbnail tool add Thumbnail Helper Gizmo to fine-tune automatic framing NOTE: framing of the thumbnail is internally based on bbox(es) but they may not represent the ideal or desired space the asset should occupy within a thumbnail so the helper gizmo will overwrite the asset's bbox Group tools Group Mode (Outliner) disable group gizmos when

indicate entire assembly asset object count support assembly/asset creation from selection only (and so for a part of a hierarchy only) previously - for selection convenience - the entire object hierarchy determined and used for assembly/asset creation now you can optionally create assemblies/assets from parts only, for instance, only the thigh of a robot leg support assembly/asset creation without duplication (enable in addon prefs) support adding tags and meta data base average assembly origin location on non-wire objects preferably improve main _Assembly collection creation (previously called _Assets ), and support multiple (per-scene) across a single blend file rename and invert behavior of previous Unlink Asset prop to Drop Asset into Scene set collection colors, green for the main _Assemblies collection, orange for actual assembly asset collections with a single asset browser open at time of asset creation select 'All' pseudo catalog in 'Current File' library add ResetAssemblyOrigin tool zero out collection's instance_offset and compensate collection objects accordingly this ensures the assembly's origin is exactly in the world origin within the instance collection support user made instance collections too add CleanNonAssets tool used to prepare a file for saving in an asset library, avoiding file bloat removes everything in a blend file that is not an asset or related to one also keeps fake user data, that can optionally be removed manually lays out all object and collection assets and fake users on the view layer Assemblies get sorted by size, and are distributed on thew X axis organizes objects and collections into three main collections: _Assemblies, _Assets, _FakeUsers sort DECALmachine backups and MESHmachine stash objects into dedicated sub-collections SetAssemblyOrigin tool (previously SetInstanceCollectionOffset) default to work relatively to the active assembly/instance collection empty legacy behavior (relative to original objects) can be enabled from redo panel or via 'SHIFT' mod key support user made instance collections too UpdateThumbnail tool support NODETREE assets DisassembleAssembly tool support disassembling instance collections with child collections and their contained objects NOTE: assembly assets so far only ever contain on collection, due to this Blender bug sort disassembled decals (from DECALmachine) into decal collections, depending on DM's collection settings assetbrowser bookmarks bar avoid unnecessary changes to capitalization of user library names fix exception when Filebrowser tools are not active also Group tools support drawing group relationships draw group origins and distinguish between active and other groups by color draw lines visualising parenting hierarchies optionally draw lines to group objects optionally draw the active group, useful for massive scenes with thousands of objects, that would otherwise slow things down Outliner expose parenting button to visually indicate if object parenting is shown or not significantly flesh out Group Mode (toggled via 1 key by default) indicate if you are in group mode via red label in outliner header automatically toggle group relationship drawing improve outliner layout changes and restoration of initial state when entering/leaving group mode by default - when entering group mode - disable auto select, recursive select and group empty hiding disabling auto select in particular, helps manually changing group hierarchies by dragging group empties around in the outliner, and avoids unindented hierarchy changes automatically respond to those changes and update internal group properties accordingly, so there is no more need to run the Group Select tool afterwards avoid applying outliner filter_text , when there are no other empties but group empties or when group prefixes or suffixes are not actually used flesh out Group Origin Adjustment mode automatically toggle group

properly, when disabling the unlink option UpdateAssetThumbnail tool support creating COLLECTION , MATERIAL and POSE / ACTION asset thumbnails NOTE: all still require an OBJECT selection in the 3D view support ALT mod key to ensure overlays are rendered too, useful if you want armatures to show up in the thumbnail for instance fix exception in asset browser, when active asset is not of type OBJECT FileBrowser tools in AssetBrowser import method selection is now a modal tool hold 4 key and move mouse horizontally support modal thumbnail size adjustment in asset shelfs too now like in the File- or AssetBrowser, hold 3 key while over an asset shelf, and move mouse horizontally drop legacy non-modal behavior (then still optional) and remove option to disable it in addon prefs accordingly MaterialPicker tool support picking materials from objects within instance collection assets SmartVert tool use uvs=True arg when center- or last-merging SmartEdge tool support creasing, when invoked via SHIFT + 2 SmartFace tool when multiple objects are in edit mesh mode, support creating multiple new objects from face selections optionally support joining multiple separated objects into one by default clear mods on separated objects now Focus tool in View Selected mode, ignore arrays by default now too, unless disabled in redo panel just as already done with mirror mods, focus on the original, not the evaluated results of these modifiers Mirror tool support mirroring Grease Pencil v3 objects in Blender 4.3 Customize tool disable F keymap in grease pencil edit mode you can still toggle cyclicity using ALT + C but with F freed, view_selected can take over now M3 theme set asset shelf colors Tools pie like the SurfaceDraw tool before, move Grease Pencil options from Modes pie to here as well now: ShrinkWrapGreasePencil tool and surface distance prop Thickness and Opacity modifier access, when present add Annotation Note tool point the cursor at part of an object, call the pie, pick the Note tool, start typing finish via LEFTMOUSE or CTRL + RETURN see statusbar for options: screen X aligned by default, toggle Cursor X align via CTRL + S or CTRL + C size is determined automatically, but can be changed by scrolling mouse remove words via CTRL + W , remove all via CTRL + U or CTRL + BACKSPACE in 4.2 Notes are Annotation based in 4.3 due to crippling of the annotation API, Grease Pencil objects will be created instead pro parented to object contra pollutes scene in solid shading has solid color, not annotation color may require multiply blend to be legible minimum

objects SurfaceDraw tool update for 4.3's v3 Grease Pencils when invoking Line tool using SHIFT mod key, ensure sufficient subdivision count when subdivisions are currently < 10 NOTE: you can always simplify later again, but you want to avoid having not enough subdivisions when drawing on curved surfaces ShrinkwrapGreasePencil tool update for 4.3's v3 Grease Pencils with an active GP object, expose it's layers and some layer props now too when in Grease Pencil PAINT mode, expose Draw, Line and Erase tools with Line tool selected, expose line subdivisions prop too when in Grease Pencil EDIT mode, expose native Stroke Simplify tool fix HOps menu not appearing when installed as extension Save pie avoid exposing fbx export when default fbx addon is disabled add glTF import/export support add Better FBX import/export support Load Next/Previous tools pop confirmation dialog when file has unsaved changes, to avoid accidental data loss Clean out scene tool support 4.3 annotations removal and empty annotation layer re-creation Modes pie support Blender 4.3 Grease Pencil v3 rewrite move grease pencil options from here to Tools pie Shrinkwarp tool, Surface distance prop, Thickness and Opacity modifier access, when present add VERTEX_GPENCIL / VERTEX_GREASE_PENCIL modes to tiny modes bar when active object is GP in grease pencil paint mode, expose stroke placement popup flesh out SCULPT , PAINT_TEXTURE , PAINT_WEIGHT , PAINT_VERTEX and PARTICLE modes in each expose object, vert, edge and face mode toggles now Snapping pie support setting snap element additively using ALT mod key indicate snap element(s) at the top of the pie draw fading label when setting one of the presets indicating the current snap target and snap element(s) use CLOSEST target for absolute grid snapping enable snap_show_absolute_grid prefs by default now Shading pie expose rotation, if mapping node is connected to image node, which in turn is connected to the background node fix exception for world setup using background node with connected image texture when detecting a trace_max_roughness of 0 while raytracing is enabled, reset it to its default of 0.5 opening up pre-4.2 files seems to set this value to 0, but with it at 0, all metals will look like plastic print warning message to terminal when doing this fix angle prop not being in degrees when replacing invalid auto smooth also recreate show_expanded and use_pin_to_last props when adding auto smooth mod via the toggle (not via the presets), ensure an angle of 20\u00b0 is used, not the default 30\u00b0 Transform pie indicate current choice of pivot and orientation by depressing buttons accordingly Cursor Pie fix Origin to Cursor button width when multiple mesh modes are selected at the same time addon preferences be more verbose in filebrowser/assetbrowser keymap labels in keymaps tab GetSupport tool check for and list workspaces that have addon filtering enabled fix assetbrowser tool prefs not showing up remove some legacy prefs that are no longer used indicate if a MACHIN3tools update is available in 3D view's sidebar and addon prefs 1.10.1 2024-08-05 AssetBrowser tools rework MakeLocal tool completely fix issues on more complex linked assets of assets, and sometimes even on simple linked assets making objects local (regular or instance collection) is tiered now by default and if the selected object is linked, only the object itself will be made local this allows you to position, scale, and rotate the object, while its data or linked instance collection remain linked, and so only exist in an external file only on the second run, or when holding down SHIFT , or when the object itself is not linked and only its data or instance collection is, are data and/or instance collection made local too instance collections are only ever made local one level down so for recursive linked instance collections, you could keep the lower level linked while making the upper level local or disassemble it CreateAssemblyAsset tool fix occasional black thumbnails fix exception, when choosing to not unlink empty DisassembleAssembly tool use new logic from MakeLocal tool to ensure linked assemblies are made local properly Save pie add ReloadLibraries tool reload libraries when linked data blocks are used Modes pie improve handling of linked or partially linked objects by detecting if object data or instance collection is linked, even if object itself is not linked (anymore) Group tool add workaround for Blender 4.2 \"object loses transform bug on redo\" bug Cursor and Origin pie OriginToBottomBounds tool add workaround for Blender 4.2 \"object loses transform bug on redo\" bug CreateDoFEmpty (Prime only) fix exception when drawing fading label SmartEdge tool fix issue in Korean Bevel mode remove unnecessary imports all over 1.10 2024-08-01 AssetBrowser tools CreateAssemblyAsset tool rework completely and massively simplify the UX and exposed options always duplicate the original objects for use in the instance collection and always removed MM stashes and DM backups on those duplicates avoid moving instance collection objects into world origin, make use of instance_offset instead always add asset collection to the viewlayer in the new _Assets collection, which itself is on, but excluded from the view layer (so isn't rendered) this aims to make things more transparent, bc you can now can easily see which asset collections exist in the file by default, unlink the asset empty, so the asset only appears in the AssetBrowser's LOCAL/Current File library if disabled bring back an instance of it, offset in front of the original object(s) redo thumbnail rendering perfectly frame the asset automatically, no matter where it is on the viewport, incl. for recursive assets (of assets) support camera view rendering (incl. Depth of Field) and cycles rendering support placing asset empty in Cursor location add Disassemble tool replaces previously awkwardly named AssembleInstanceCollection tool makes assembly asset/instance collection objects accessible when assembly is linked, make it local first support Rigid Body setup if assembly objects make use of it add MakeLocal tool makes assembly local without disassembling unlike the native op it properly deals with only the selection, but also goes recursively through the entire assert, to deal with linked assets of assets whereas the native make_local op would have to be run with the ALL argument, which would then affect ALL linked id types in the entire blend file however add RemoveAssemblyAsset tool by default it removes the assembly empty + instance collection, if that no longer has any other users (such as other assemblies using the same instance collection) for local assets, it can optionally completely remove the entire asset and all instances of it from the file naturally, this then removes it from the asset browser too for legacy assets (those created with prior versions, that didn't duplicate the original objects yet) just disassemble the asset/assembly and let the user decide if the collection objects should be removed add UpdateAssetThumbnail tool can be called from the 3D view's sidebar simply by selecting any local assembly asset or alternatively from thee asset browser's sidebar here it requires selecting the asset itself, and any object(s) in the 3D view expose assembly asset collection name in asset browser's sidebar AssetBrowser Bookmarks add pseudo-bookmark for LOCAL (Current File) library keymapped to ALT + ^ by default when using this, MACHIN3tools will auto size thumbnails based on asset browser dimensions NOTE: it's not possible to set All or Unassigned catalogs from the API so instead MACHIN3tools will select the most used catalog in the file to ensure something is shown at all also note, that Blender doesn't even list catalogs that exist in a file, if that file is not stored in an asset library location fix some issues where the wrong library and catalog where displayed in the header Material Picker tool support multiple 3d views and asset browsers open at the same time pick/assign from any 3d view or asset browser on the workspace support picking from and assigning to FONT, SURFACE and META objects Filebrowser tools support modal thumbnail size adjustment just hold down the 3 and move the mouse horizontally feel free to remap to CTRL + MIDDLEMOUS\u00c8 click-drag, to mirror Blender native panel scaling you can disable this modal behavior in the addon preferences for legacy-style thumbnail size cycling using 3 and ALT + 3 accordingly fix opening active folder in system's file browser via O Group tools Outliner Group mode toggle (via 1 key) when group auto-naming is enabled in addon preferences, further filter the outliner to consider the group prefix and/or suffix this way you can truly only have group empties show up, instead of all empties CreateGroup tool when un-groupable (already parented) objects are among the selection, indicate that they weren't added to the group also increase fading label time when there are un-groupable objects Groupify tool stop adding _GROUP to the empty names support auto-naming addon pref and with it disabled, just keep the original empty names accordingly redo/simplify general group naming logic Smart Edge tool support connecting lose/non-manifold verts, thanks Artem! Align tool add workaround in 4.2 for \"object loses transform on redo\" bug Customize tool in Blender 4.2, support addon installation from extensions repo Icon Viewer LoopTools Screencast Keys preferences enable GPU compositing keymaps change curve.select_more and curve.select_less keymaps to SHIFT + WHEEL UP/DOWN , inline with mesh and UV selections change outliner CTFL + F search keymap

None, Low, High and Ultra Presets, check tooltips for details support finding and applying user-created raytrace presets expose passes incl. quick access to Shadow and Ambient Occlusion expose fast GI related props introduce multi props for resolution, thickness and quality(precision) these set screen-trace and fast GI props at the same time add bloom and dispersion toggles both are setup and then toggled via realtime compositing add volume rendering toggle with volume objects present, toggle volume object filtering in the viewport without volume objects, the world volume (node) is toggled, or created when there is none yet force world volume creation via SHIFT when volume objects are present, but you want to setup a world volume too when enabled, expose main world volume node props in MATERIAL or RENDERED Eevee shading expose new World Shadow and \"Sun Angle\" props for adjustment of HDRI/world based shadows Cycles expose bloom and dispersion toggles here too same for Volume rendering expose world environment props, if found generic support for props named: 'Power', 'Multiply', 'Rotate Z', 'Rotation', 'Blur' Easy HDRI support for props: 'Sun Strength', 'Sky Strength', 'Custom Background', 'Solid Color', 'Rotation' Shade Smooth and Toggle Auto Smooth in Blender 4.2 prevent unintended removal of an existing auto smooth mod caused change in behavior of native Smooth operator replace all invalid Auto Smoth mods (often as a result of appending or pasting legacy objects) Shade Flat fix fading HUD instance counter in 4.1, and ensure auto smooth removals are counted properly in 4.2 Blender 4.1+ unmark the Smooth by Angle node group asset when bringing it in from the ESSENTIALS lib Bevel Shader exclude CURVES, VOLUME, ARMATURE, LATTICE and META object types from bevel shader setup attempts update Wireframe button to better show what being toggled depending on context Views pie Smart Cam by default, support perfect viewport matching now adjusts scene resolution ratio to match viewport region matches viewport Field of View sets camera's sensor width to 72 can be disabled in addon preferences add fading HUD Next/Prev Camera tools add fading HUD when in camera view support naming the camera expose camera sensor width add Depth of Field utilities add CreateDoFEmpty tool quickly sets up an empty as the DoF focus object and invokes translate tool, ready to snap the empty to a surface add Select DoF object tool select (and reveal if hidden) currently used DoF focus object Save pie in Blender 4.2 ScreenCasting default to ScreenCast Keys extension over SKRIBE make Toggle Region op show up in screencasted operator list Purge Orphans preview purging, by invoking the tool with SHIFT key pressed fix .stl import/export due to API change Export tools expose custom export folders per-export type in addon preferences if set, the exporter will open in theses folders, instead of in the home dir Purge tool remove empty collections, which native Blender doesn't do as long as they are on the viewlayer Clean out .blend file tool remove node groups explicitly now, otherwise there may be left over ones, IF they are still marked as asset or fake user update custom brush removal in Blender 4.2 remove libraries too now disable use_scene_world and use_scene_lights update poll to reflect all the data types that are to be removed Tools pie add annotate line tool with active annotation tool add Show/Hide Annotations tool hides and reveals annotation layers remembers previously hidden layers and only reveals those, that were previously visible expose surface placement settings as buttons, not as list bring back BoxCutter and HardOps support due to popular demand bring back SurfaceDraw tool (previously in the Modes pie) by default disabled in the addon preferences Modes pie add Guide mesh < > Final Mesh Editor support for quick access to the addon's Dual Mesh Edit mode prevent initiating Surface Slide, when mesh has shapekeys prevent rare exception when trying to sync tools Workspace pie in Blender 4.2, support Blender Icon Viewer installation from extensions repo it's exposed in the addon preferences when syncing viewports from one workspace to another, sync shading.use_compositor and shading.render_pass too now Snapping Pie fix absolute grid snapping exception in 4.2 due to API change addon preferences Keymaps in Blender 4.2, point out Shading pie and Views pie conflicts, due to new native Page Up/Down keymappings for Sculpt mode visibility filtering expose these keymappins for easy remapping, if desired Restore Missing Keymaps tool add debug output and print to the system console which keymap items have been missing and now restored fix potential exception 1.9 2024-05-23 MaterialPicker tool add RIGHTMOUSE keymap for now disabled by default, so please enable manually in addon prefs if you use RIGHTMOUSE for the context menu, you can add a mod key in the MACHIN3tools keymap prefs for RMB-material-picking/assigning I highly recommend you try this, IMO it's a game changer the tool is only active on views that show materials: MATERIAL shading, RENDERED shading, and SOLID shading IF MATERIAL is chosen as the color_type NOTE: in SOLID shading make use of the Colorize Materials tool in the Shading pie, if all your materials show as white the tool existing in 3 modes : PICK, ASSIGN, ASSIGN_FROM_ASSETBROWSER which one of these are available, depends on presence of material editor, asset browser, object or face selection for instance, without a material editor or asset browser on the workspace, but with an object selection present, the tool will invoke into ASSIGN mode automatically with an object or face selection present, support clearing materials using X when appending material from assetbrowser attempt to set the material's viewport color support assigning material from asset browser to entire object selection using ALT as opposed to just the object the mouse is over via LEFTMOUSE in the HUD try to draw picked or to-be-assigned material's color under its name, fetched from the Base Color input of the last node in object mode list objects that are to be assigned a material and lightly draw object wires in edit mode indicate if material is to be assigned to face selection fix button not appearing in RENDERED viewport (even though enabled in addon prefs) Filebrowser tools, Assetbrowser tools, AssetBrowser Bookmarks, Toggle Region tool support asset browser display_type cycling + storage NOTE: this is not natively exposed in the Blender UI, but internally the asset browser is still just a Filebrowser in Blender, and so the display_type can still be changed cycle between display types: THUMBNAIL LIST_VERTICAL LIST_HORIZONTAL use the 2 key, just as in the Filebrowser (same keymap item in fact) for asset browser display_type cycling use previously unused (in asset browser) 4 keymap to cycle asset import method now also draw button to cycle through Assetbrowser display_types in asset browser header Shading pie 4.1 Auto Smooth expose and make the auto smooth angle accessible, even on meshes with custom normals expose setting in addon prefs to keep Auto Smooth mod expanded in mod stack, not collapsed if not found itn he file already, append Smooth by Angle nodegroup from ESSENTIALS lib, without relying native op when opening the pie look for invalid auto smooth mod and remove it Blender can sometimes create these, especially when pasting or appending objects from legacy files terminal will complain about missing Angle or Ignore Sharps inputs in that case in SOLID shading with MATERIAL color_type chosen, expose active object's active material's viewport color support wireframe toggling and wireframe opacity adjustment in SCULPT mode BevelShader setup prevent exception when materials without node_tree are encountered, like Blender's Fur Material Shade Smooth tool update description to mention sharp edges are based on operator prop, not auto smooth angle any longer Modes pie support EDIT_CURVES + SCULPT_CURVES modes disable \"SurfaceDraw\"-pseudo-mode, use Annotate tools from tools pie instead! Tools pie add annotate buttons at the bottom remove out Hops/BC buttons, I don't think anybody uses the pie for these? simplify HyperCursor / Select Box alternation this now allows easy switching from HC to annotating, and back avoid always force-enabling HC gizmos, when switching into HC tool too Workspace Pie add Geo Nodes workspace to bottom left SelectHierarchy tool support selecting geo nodes mod objects ToggleSmooth tool use SHIFT + TAB as the default on Windows ApplyTransform tool ensure object has data block, so transform can actually be applied addon preferences mention Bevel Shader in Render tools description it is exposed through the Shading pie, but enabled through the Render tools add ResetKeymaps and RestoreKeymaps buttons in keymaps tab IF there are user modified keymaps or missingkeymaps (due to user removal, accidental or not) improve how keymap items are drawn Customize tool M3 theme define compliant colors for Attribute Editor/Spreadsheet space use fully transparent color for front-facing face orientation color lower the alpha of the back-facing face orientation color (red) overlays when the M3 theme is being installed enable the face orientation overlays startup file set (annotate) stroke placement to SURFACE and set eraser size to 50px keymaps disable node.select keymappings in Node Tool: Select Box keymap in 2.7x keymap set node.select keymappings in Node Editor keymap from RIGHTMOUSE to LEFGMOUSE using PRESS events this allows for additive and subtractive node selection using SHIFT + LMB without delay system enable experimental asset debug info 1.8 2024-03-22 DeusEx SetupGroupGizmos tool add option to lock axes, that don't carry a gizmo this then allows for easy and lazy group rotation using the native op, without having to pick the right axis, and even with the rotation gizmo(s) disabled disable locking via R or L keys Prime previously Standard Assetbrowser tools add Assetbrowser Bookmarks draw buttons for 10 bookmarks in the asset browser header support jumping to library/catalog via click, saving via SHIFT click, and clearing bookmarks via CTRL click, see tooltips support jumping to library/catalog via new ALT + 1 to ALT + 0 keymaps bookmarks store and recall library, catalog and thumbnail size bookmarks are stored on disk in assetbrowser_bookmarks.json in Blender's config folder with the catalog sidebar closed, display the library and catalog in the asset browser header support maintaining bookmarks, across Library renames (Blender restart required) NOTE: you can't bookmark any catalog in the 'Current File' library and you can't bookmark any library's 'Unassigned' catalog either Shading Pie BevelShader support toggling it per-object add arrow buttons to increase or decrease the global or per-object radius halve and double the current value by default with SHIFT held down, do -25% or +33% instead for smaller adjustments Smooth, Flat, Auto Smooth tools redo them completely, and maintainthe same look and UX in 4.1 as before in Blender 4.1 support Auto Smooth toggling byp adding/removing goe node mod sort it at the end of the stack, but before mirror and array mods support instanced objects support Auto Smooth for CURVE objects support SURFACE objects in object mode (Blender does too, so why not) properly deal with hidden children and mod objects when in local view and when either or both are included in a Smooth or Flat shading operation when shading Smooth, optionally (but by default) enable Auto Smooth for objects carrying boolean mods when shading Smooth with ALT pressed, sharpen edges via new operator angle property, not via a mesh's auto smooth angle prop as before when Flat shading with ALT pressed to clear sharps, seams, etc, also disable Auto Smooth, if enabled, or present limit options, that are exposed in redo panel, depending on context, hide what doesn't apply when Flat shading and removing creases, make option, that avoids removal of creases while subd mods with use_crease are present, work per-object not globally or entire selection add object mode fading HUD summarizing the shading changes display Clear Custom Normals op, independently of Auto Smooth being enabled in 4.1 neither custom normals nor sharp edges require Auto Smooth anymore Modes Pie Surface Slide tool support instanced meshes avoid exception when trying to mode change a linked object with library override MaterialPicker tool support fetching materials from and assigning them to CURVE objects SelectHierarchy tool indicate number of hidden parents/children in fading HUD Group Add/Remove tools add little fading HUD to visually confirm what happened ToggleRegion tool avoid exception when library stored asset browser settings, is no longer registered Thread, ToggleSmooth and QuadSphere tools deal with Auto Smooth changes in 4.1 CreateAssemblyAsset tool fix issues caused by 1.7's change to UUID based catalog storage addon preferences add GetSupport tool, placed at the top of the addon prefs add custom updater NOTE: since it's only introduced now in 1.8, it will only be of use for upcoming releases, so can't be used to install this very 1.8 update yet allows for very easy addon update installation from .zip file, and from inside of Blender, instead of manually from the file browser finds matching .zip file(s) in home and Downloads folder allows selecting one of them them or manually selecting a file in any other location extracts the file to a temporary location, and installs update when quitting Blender like a manual update installation from the filebrowser, this maintains previous addon settings and custom keys see installation instructions for details Customize tool tweak M3 theme adjust to edit mode color changes in 4.1 make crease edges green when customizing the startup file, while the Shading Pie has been activated, disable native cursor display and activate custom cursor and object axes drawing instead fix issues modifying keymap in 4.1 add hidden Toolbar Popup keymaps set Annotate to D set Annotate Erase to E without deliberately creating these keymaps, the default keymaps will change depending on the active tool, now they persist invert Transform Modal Map's proportional editing keymaps increase the size by scrolling UP and decrease by scrolling DOWN 1.7 2024-02-10 Standard SelectHierarchy tool support UP selection too now including recursive, and unhiding keymaped to UP , SHIFT+UP , CTRL+UP and SHIFT+CTRL+UP accordingly add fading HUD indicate if top or bottom are reached when not undhiding, indicate if top or bottom with hidden parents/children is reached if a group empty is among the new selection, ensure the highest in the hierarchy becomes the active object ToggleRegion tool support toggling toolbar and sidebar in all node editors support toggling toolbar and sidebar in UV/Image editor avoid unnecessarily drawing \"Not enough space\" warning when toggling sidebar, while region_overlap disabled Blender is weird sometimes Thread tool raise maximum fade from 50% to 100% (one revolution) Filebrowser tools in AssetBrowser fix exception when trying to open asset without having an active asset chosen fix rare issue not being able to open an asset's path in system filebrowser or to open asset .blend file in second Blender instance it turns out the same catalog can be present multiple times, with different UUIDs SmartEdge tool fix issue with Offset Edges mode, when undoing Groups change empty draw type of active group to SPHERE, while others remaining CUBE update group panel in sidebar Group tool draw a fading message when no group could be created, because the entire selection is parented to something already SurfaceSlide, Focus and Screencast HUDs take region_overlap and theme's header alpha into account as well! it turns out a theme's header alpha at 1, essentially force-disables region_overlap Modes pie SurfaceSlide fix bottom HUD offset, depending on header and tool header positioning Shading pie Bevel Shader in Blender 4 connect to Coat Normal input too support bevel shader on DECALmachine panel decals and trimsheet materials automatically adjust panel decal bevel shader width, when parent object's bevel width is modulated fix 2 nodes not being removed when, when bevel shader is disabled again support creating new world if none is present in scene and

related to real-time compositing and groups skip DECALmachine post-asset-drop decal backup object cleanup, when DM has that capability already next update skip MESHmachine post-asset-drop stash object cleanup, when MM has that capability already next update DeusEx Groups support multiple poses (any number) per group empty expose group poses in group panel in sidebar support setting, recalling, updating, previewing, sorting and naming of poses support creating batch poses batch poses are poses on different empties in the the same group hierarchy, that are linked together they can be batch-recalled too think hand poses, where each finger joint empty has it's own pose, but they are all tied together to create a hand pose support (temporarily) unlinking specific batch poses from the other poses in the batch support retrieving poses even when group gizmos are not shown Group + Groupify tools automatically create Inception poses on group creation add SetupGroupGizmo tool modal tool to quickly and conveniently setup the group gizmos directly from the 3D view instead of from the sidebar panel support view based axis selection and toggling via TAB or T keys support axis toggling via X , Y , Z keys accordingly support all-axes toggling via A key support gizmo size adjustment via mouse wheel (or 1 and 2 keys) support precision adjustment via SHIFT and CTRL mod keys support toggling gizmo display via S or D keys TransformGroup tool flesh out HUD and draw line from group origin to mouse, HyperCursor style support selecting group empty (and finishing without rotating) via G key support switching to SetupGroupGizmo tool (and finishing without rotating) via Q key remove gizmo size adjustment via mouse wheel use SetupGroupGizmo tool now support creating new pose and finish via S key (as before, but now you can create any number of poses per group) support previewing and selecting poses by scrolling release LMB to recall the previewed pose and finish press SPACE to finish without recalling the selected pose when invoking the rotation, initiate pose selection automatically, when group empty is already at a certain pose, when group rotation is initiated except for the Inception pose mark selected pose for removal via X key, and removal of all via A remove previous R keymap for pose retrieval remove previous K keymap for auto-keying for now SavePie Screencast support group pose tools (Set, Retrieve, Update, etc) v1.6 2023-11-10 add ToggleRegion tool a single T keymap to toggle Toolbar T-Panel , Sidebar N-Panel , and asset shelf/browser depending on mouse position on the screen NOTE: the new asset shelf is not very useful in Blender 4.0 yet, so toggling that is disabled by default, but can be enabled and used, if desired more interesting is toggling a new asset browser area at the top or bottom of the 3d view it will remember the previously chosen library and catalog_id as well as all asset browser settings such as thumbnail_size, import_method, filter choices and filter search term, as well as header alignment the previously set height of the asset browser area is remembered too and all of this per-workspace! so on each workspace you can have 2 different asset browsers that can be neatly tucked away or revealed when needed an asset browser can then be closed not only with the mouse in the 3d view, but with the mouse in center of the asset browser too, as if it were a region, not an area with the mouse towards the sides of the asset browser, you can toggle the library/catalog selection or active asset details, also just via a T press NOTE: this tool is enabled by default in MACHIN3tools now ALSO: check addon prefs for some tweaks in behavior you can make, and make sure you watch the short video about the tool, due to some Blender shenanigans Shading Pie store per-shading type overlay visibility on scene level expose default overlay visibility settings to addon prefs deal with out of sync overlay visibility settings, which can happen if the user toggles overlays using other means Bevel Shader add option (default on) to consider mesh dimensions to modulate the bevel shader this prevents small object from having massive bevels you still have the option to modulate per-object on top of that compensate for object scaling Shade Smooth/Flat tools fix 4.0 issues due to bevel weight and crease API changes Save Pie ScreenCast fix vertical positioning support .stl import/export, disabled by default Views Pie SmartViewCam add poll to ensure it only runs in object mode Collection Pie remove

Note Customization is deeply personal. The tools is primarily meant for myself, to set up Blender how I myself like it. But feel free to pick and choose only some parts of it. For instance, you could pick only the Theme or Matcaps. When run, the tool will print every single change it does to the system console. Those same changes are also listed below. Theme The M3 theme is a merger of Flatty Dark Blueberry for general UI colors, and Pawe\u0142 \u0141yczkowski's rTheme for 3D View colors. Matcaps The following 4 Matcaps are supplied with MACHIN3tools and will be copied to Blender's matcap folder, if matcap customization is enabled. matcap_base.exr matcap_shiny_red.exr matcap_zebra_horizontal.exr matcap_zebra_vertical.exr Shading and Rendering Note Shading changes will affect the currently open blend file/scene.

It's not a scene or mesh level constraint setting, that you can enable, and then have various blender tools behave in an edge constrained manner. Rotation A generalized solution for edge constrained rotation that behaves great in all topological conditions, seems very hard. So the tool provides different constraint modes to scroll through - each with various benefits and drawbacks. Some modes have a tendency to bend the selection the more you rotate. The default mode Direct Plane Intersection does generally not do that, but can instead introduce some jittering, depending on the selection and transform origin. Proximity mode, which is the most robust due to it's simplicity, will introduce bending and is generally best used as a fallback and for small rotation amounts. Scaling Edge constrained Scaling does not require the choice of a constraint mode. It is scaling directionally , which means how the mouse is positioned relative to the transform origin matters and will affect the scaling, unlike when rotating. When scaling down, and so when one approaches the transform origin, it tends to get increasingly hard to maintain the initial scaling direction.

MACHIN3tools comes in two base variants - Prime and DeusEx . Prime already contains almost everything - measured in lines of code not the best way to do it! Prime is 85% of the DeusEx variant. But DeusEx contains a few more-advanced tools not present in the Prime variant. They are: the Edge Constrained Transform tool Group Gizmos and Poses the Punch It manifold Extrusion tool, similar to the one in the dedicated PUNCHit addon advanced Assembly/Asset tools like Assembly Editing, Assembly Variants, Assembly Origin Orientation/Rotation Adjustment, and more Where can I purchase MACHIN3tools? All my addons are sold on two markets: Buy MACHIN3tools on Superhive formerly known as Blender Market Buy MACHIN3tools on Gumroad How to get the Update? If you have previously bought MACHIN3tools, you can download it by going to the store's site, and then just download the latest version you have access to accordingly. Download MACHIN3tools from Superhive formerly known as Blender Market Download MACHIN3tools from Gumroad See update installation instructions for details on how to do the actual installation once you have downloaded the MACHIN3tools .zip file. How do paid Updates work? If you are outside the 1 year free-updates period, I would kindly ask to purchase an update variant which unlocks access to the very latest version again. Paid Updates work like this: A new sale of Prime or DeusEx will include free feature updates for 1 year starting at the purchase date. Should there ever be no feature update within that year, then the free update period is extended by another year. The download from Superhive formerly Blender Market or Gumroad will always automatically supply the correct version. You just download the addon as you always have from the market. Should there be a newer version available than what you have access to - because your original purchase was done more than a year ago - then a download link to your previous version is provided, as well as a message about the new paid update with a link to it too. To update to the latest version, purchase the MACHIN3tools Prime or DeusEx Update Variant on Blender Market or Gumroad - depending on where you bought your MACHIIN3tools base variant . For Prime you need the Prime Update Variant . For DeusEx you need the DeusEx Update Variant . The link directly to the required update variant is also provided to you on the Update Available page you see, when you access your download. I think this update system is fair to you and to me. I think it's easy, transparent and straight forward to use. If you have any question however, feel free to reach out . Why aren't Updates free? Continuous updates require continues work, and so continuous time spent on development and documentation. MACHIN3tools was completely free for the first 3 years of its existence, which was my way of giving back to the community. In 2021 - with the 0.8 release - I introduced the optional DeusEx variant which added a few more advanced tools, that could have easily been dedicated single purpose addons, in fact many other tools in MACHIN3tools could be as well. I did charge a little for DeusEx, but kept the base Standard variant free and kept adding to and evolving it too. Last year in 2024 - with the 1.8 release - I had to retire the free Standard variant and introduced the paid Prime variant of MACHIN3tools, in an attempt to counter a decline in revenue I had already seen for about a year then, and so to continue being able to pour significant development resources into MACHIN3tools. It's one year later now, and the decline has unfortunately only accelerated, in particular over the past 6 months. Hence why I have no choice now but to charge a little for feature updates. The reality is MACHIN3tools was always extremely under-priced for the amount of tools it contains, and was heavily subsidized by the success of my other addons, in particular DECALmachine and MESHmachine of course, which are priced more realistically. I work constantly on these addons - it's all I do, to the point that I have pushed my own artistic ambitions to the side for almost a decade now - and I could just release dedicated smaller addons, as a result of that work - like other creators do, but instead I have so far chosen to evolve my existing addons, tools and workflows, and have released these efforts as free updates. With a decline in revenue across the board , this is no longer a working strategy now however. So some change is unavoidable now. You promised free updates forever! No, I never did that. Not once did I ever promise anybody free updates for life. Instead, I have told anyone who asked about it, that I can only continue doing this for as long as there are sufficient new sales. This is no longer the case now, and hasn't been for a few months. This is not a hobby for me. It's what I do, and how I pay my bills and provide for my family. Blender is free, addons must be free too! Blender is free for you because it\u2019s sustained by tens of thousands of donors and a well-established funding structure. That level of financial support enables full-time employment for a dozen or so developers, infrastructure, and long-term planning. I am unfortunately not in that position - and my addons would never have existed, had I tried to build them relying on donations. Despite what the Blender Foundation often claims - that there is a proven open source business model - the truth is that this model only works under very specific conditions: institutional backing and huge corporate sponsors - 60%-70% in Blender's case 1 , a massive user base and consistent, high-volume donations. No independent developer has that luxury. The open source world is littered with abandoned projects. Not because they weren\u2019t useful or well-made, but because the people behind them couldn\u2019t afford to keep working for free and burnt out. Relying on voluntary contributions is not a business model; it\u2019s a gamble. The harsh reality is this: people overwhelmingly expect software for free, but very few are willing to contribute financially in return. Even popular, widely used tools often receive only a trickle of donations. That\u2019s not sustainable. Putting a price on addons is what allows artists like me to invest time, effort, and long-term support into making tools that work, evolve, and expand on what Blender is and can do. If we want a thriving ecosystem of powerful, well-maintained tools around Blender, we need to stop treating paid addons as a betrayal of open source ideals. They are what keep independent development alive. In fact, they are what keep Blender truly independent. Update Pricing If you bought MACHIN3tools less than a year ago , then the latest version is free for you . I want to keep update prices as low as possible, and originally intended to do 10% of the product price, but with MACHIN3tools already priced so low and with market fees as high as they are - including a flat fee of $0.49 for payment processing, I can't do just 10% for MACHIN3tools or I wouldn't earn anything, which would defeat the purpose. And so the Prime Update will be $2.00 - of which I earn ~$0.70 after taxes the DeusEx Update will be $4.00 - of which I earn ~$1.70 after taxes active Patrons in the Army tier are entitled to free MACHIN3tools feature updates Core tier and above are entitled to free feature updates on all my products Is this a subscription? No it's very much not a subscription , because I'm not forcing anybody to update to use MACHIN3tools. Not now, not ever. You are free to use the version you already have access to for as long as you like (with the supported Blender versions). Still, I expect significant push-back, simply based on the push-back and bad ratings I got in response to retiring the Standard variant and introducing Prime before. But as I said, I have no choice. It is what it is. TM I can't be expected to work for free, or I'll be out of business in a year or so. That all said, if this goes well, then I'm open to extend the 1 year period to 2 years. Nothing is set in stone here, I'll be flexible, and just have to see how it goes. If it doesn't go well, then I'll have to stop doing these huge workflow addons with dozens of tools and dozens of updates, and instead switch gears and work on smaller, single-purpose addons, that I can push out in the same time or less then I'd usually spend on these big feature updates, like many other creators in the space do and have been doing for years. Can I skip updates? Absolutely! original Prime purchase and a delayed Prime Update variant purchase Let's say I release MACHIN3tools 1.12 in May 2025, and you have previously bought MACHIN3tools in January 2024, which means the most recent version you have access to is MACHIN3tools 1.11.1 from November 2024. You don't think the 1.12 release is worth it and I disagree :) , so you just wait. Let's pretend on February 1st 2026 MACHIN3tools 1.15 drops. You jump on it this time, and from then on you'll have access to MACHIN3tools 1.15 and all other feature udates updates, that may release between February 1st 2026 - your update purchase date - and January 31st 2027, so one year later. Installation How is MACHIN3tools installed? See the Installation guide for more details and do note the Blender version requirements and ensure that your system console and with that your blender configuration are in order! Note If you want to run MACHIN3tools on an older Blender version outside of the currently supported range, you can reach out to me via email and I'll supply an older addon version. Does MACHIN3tools work in Blender 5.0-alpha/beta? Using experimental builds of Blender, you are at risk of encountering sudden failures of addons that used to work just fine the day before. I can't make any guarantees if things will keep working. Fixing things that break in experimental Blender builds will not be a priority, until the experimental build approaches release. Does the MACHIN3tools work on macOS? Yes, 100%. MacOS users should install Blender properly, by following the official instructions . Avoid running it just from the Downloads folder! Note that, for dragging of files and folders, you need to hold down the COMMAND key. This will ensure AppTranslocation 2 is avoided. Furthermore, your download may not actually result in a .zip file , and instead extract automatically. This can and needs to be be changed in Safari settings . Does MACHIN3tools work on Arch Linux? Yes, 100%. In fact, I've never used Blender on anything but Linux myself. I don't use Arch btw Arch Linux users and users of other Arch based or similar rolling release distros are advised to use the official Blender builds . The Blender package in the Community repository does not supply its own Python, and does not follow official recommendations . As a consequence, your system's python version may not work properly with Blender and/or MACHIN3tools or any other addons. Note Use the official tarball from blender.org to be on the safe side, it comes with a bundled Python and is the correct version that Blender addons are built against. Get support Attention Note the Requirements in the installation guide. Make sure you are using the latest version . Confirm you've seen the installation guide . General information To provide help, I need the following: system-info.txt file - as generated by the Get Support tool. system console output - as shown in the video below Purchase Receipt - as provided by Superhive or Gumroad Keep in mind Please do use the Get Support tool in the addon preferences to create the system-info.txt file. Don't create it from Blender's help panel. It's a different one. Failed Installation If your MACHIN3tools installation fails, it's almost guaranteed, that this is due to addon/blender version mismatches, other faulty or version mismatched addons, system python version mismatches or general blender configuration issues, such as files in Blender's addon directory that shouldn't be there. All of these can affect installation attempts of new addons and cause them to fail, as they often cause a cascade of errors. None of this would be the fault of the new addon, but all of these would be obvious from the system console output. If you encounter this and can't resolve these issues on your own, then it is essential to send me the entirety of the system console , not just a screenshot of the end. In fact the beginning is often more important in these cases. I go over this and more in detail in the installation video . Addon Error/Exception If you are seeing an error/exception caused by MACHIN3tools, please also send me the system console output , ideally copied in text form, not just a single screenshot of the error popup, as that may not cover sufficient context. Keep in mind On Windows you can turn on the console from Windows > Toggle System Console . On Linux and MacOS, you need start Blender from a terminal. I do not need an image of Blender's Info View and I don't need to see Blender's Python Console either. .blend file to re-produce the issue If an error only occurs in a specific .blend file or in a certain blender context and you can reproduce it, please attach the blend file to your email as well. Try to remove remove any part of the model that doesn't contribute to the problem to keep the file size down. Contact Use eMail , not X, not Youtube, not Artstation, not Superhive messages, and not the Blender Artists thread for reporting of any issues or problems you have with the Addon. Just use email. I tend to be very responsive, but please be patient. Blender What is the System Console? How can I get the Quad Sphere popup? How can I adjust a tool's properties afterwards? In Blender the result of most tools, can be adjusted, after a tool has been called. In case of Quad Sphere for instance, you can set various properties to modify the way the sphere is created. There are 3 ways to do this: 1. Panel the operator properties panel at the bottom left of the screen 2. Popup from Keymap Redo Last popup called via a shortcut the default keys are F9 or F6 depending on your chosen keymap If you like using the popup, consider mapping it to a button on your mouse, which is how I do it. 3. Popup from Menu the Adjust Last Operation entry in the Edit Menu Why are my Keymap (or Settings) Changes not remembered after Blender re-start? First off, please do make sure any changes you make are actually saved. Note You may have to manually save your preferences, if you have disabled Auto-Save , at the bottom left corner of the preferences window. Blender Auto-Save preferences Manually saving Blender's preferences If this does not resolve your issue, then know that keymaps - and sometimes addon preferences - \"not sticking\" is a well known, Blender issue, that's impossible to reproduce for me. Past reports indicate that it not related to MACHIN3tools (or any addon in particular), but that it's deeper Blender issue. It tends to happen when: People import blender preferences from a previous version. People import blender keymaps from a previous version. People use App templates. In theory any installed addon could also affect this and mess with keymaps of other addons, if not properly implemented perhaps, or if somehow misbehaving. For instance - without putting any blame on it - a significant number of people reported that disabling hair tool (and re-enabling it again) resolved their MACHIN3tools keymap issue. You may also try disabling MACHIN3tools itself, and re-enabling it of course - but do note that this will reset all your MACHIN3tools keymaps and preferences. What will definitely work is starting from a fresh Blender config. Often people have a number of issues with their Blender config, without being aware of it. Please see the installation video for details on how to spot them. So if you do this, re-activate your addons one-by-one, and keep and eye on the system console , in particular after a Blender restart. MACHIN3tools What does Severely Hidden mean? I use the term severely hidden to refer to objects, that are only in either excluded or hidden collections. They are severely hidden because toggling their visibility normally has no effect, and so not only can't they be seen, they also can't be selected. In addons like HyperCursor in pre-release on Patreon mod objects are optionally moved to such a hidden collection for scene-organizational purposes. In MACHIN3tools tools like Shade Smooth/Flat , Assembly Asset Creation or Select Hierarchy need to be able to act on these objects, and they achieve that by linking the objects (sometimes temporarily only, and invisibly to the user) to the main scene collection . Other Addons Why is there a separate PUNCHit addon? How is it different from the Punch It tool in MACHIN3tools DeusEx? The tool in the dedicated PUNCHit addon is different as of PUNCHit version 1.1. Originally I included the same manifold extrusion tool in MACHIN3tools DeusEx, as a sign of gratitude for the existing DeusEx users, who chose to buy DeusEx while the Standard variant was free. Unfortunately, with both addons on the market, many people bought PUNCHit the addon, only to later realize - despite it being explained it BIG LETTERS on the product page - that the same tool is also available in MACHIN3tools DeusEx. Many refunds followed, due to Blender Markets duplicate purchase policy - which shouldn't even have been applied - but which created overhead and frustration for me, the customers, and Blender Market staff. So, from now on, PUNCHit - the addon - will be the only one receiving feature updates, while Punch It - the tool in MACHIN3tools Deus Ex - will only receive maintenance updates.

Should there ever be no feature update within that year, then the free update period is extended by another year. The download from Superhive formerly Blender Market or Gumroad will always automatically supply the correct version. You just download the addon as you always have from the market. Should there be a newer version available than what you have access to - because your original purchase was done more than a year ago - then a download link to your previous version is provided, as well as a message about the new paid update with a link to it too. To update to the latest version, purchase the MACHIN3tools Prime or DeusEx Update Variant on Blender Market or Gumroad - depending on where you bought your MACHIIN3tools base variant .

MACHIN3tools was completely free for the first 3 years of its existence, which was my way of giving back to the community. In 2021 - with the 0.8 release - I introduced the optional DeusEx variant which added a few more advanced tools, that could have easily been dedicated single purpose addons, in fact many other tools in MACHIN3tools could be as well. I did charge a little for DeusEx, but kept the base Standard variant free and kept adding to and evolving it too. Last year in 2024 - with the 1.8 release - I had to retire the free Standard variant and introduced the paid Prime variant of MACHIN3tools, in an attempt to counter a decline in revenue I had already seen for about a year then, and so to continue being able to pour significant development resources into MACHIN3tools. It's one year later now, and the decline has unfortunately only accelerated, in particular over the past 6 months. Hence why I have no choice now but to charge a little for feature updates. The reality is MACHIN3tools was always extremely under-priced for the amount of tools it contains, and was heavily subsidized by the success of my other addons, in particular DECALmachine and MESHmachine of course, which are priced more realistically. I work constantly on these addons - it's all I do, to the point that I have pushed my own artistic ambitions to the side for almost a decade now - and I could just release dedicated smaller addons, as a result of that work - like other creators do, but instead I have so far chosen to evolve my existing addons, tools and workflows, and have released these efforts as free updates. With a decline in revenue across the board , this is no longer a working strategy now however. So some change is unavoidable now.","title":"Why aren't Updates free?"},{"location":"faq.html#you-promised-free-updates-forever","text":"No, I never did that.

Still, feel free to report any issues you encounter. Older versions? If you want to run MACHIN3tools on an older Blender version outside of the currently supported range, you can reach out to me via email and I'll supply an older addon version. Latest MACHIN3tools The latest version is 1.13.1 released on July 19th, 2025 , available on Superhive formerly Blender Market and Gumroad . Legacy Addon? MACHIN3tools is what Blender 4.2+ calls a Legacy Addon now. This unfortunate term does not imply any obsolescence at all, it's just a distinction compared to the new extensions system. See this page to learn what's new in the latest versions, or see the changelog for the full, detailed release history. How to Download? Depending on where you bought MACHIN3tools, you can download it from the respective platform: Download MACHIN3tools from Superhive formerly known as Blender Market Download MACHIN3tools from Gumroad Also see this and the following in the FAQs for details on downloading updates. How to Install? The following video should ideally answer all your questions, and it addresses every installation issue I've seen people encounter occasionally over the past 8 years. Keep in mind If you come across an issue that isn't covered in the video, you can reach out to me via email . You can also check out the official Blender documentation on addon installation in here . Recommended Installation Method Drag and Drop (Fresh and Update Installations) Blender supports drag and dropping addon .zip files (both legacy and extension addons!) from your system's filebrowser on the open Blender application to do the installation. This is super convenient, and also works for update installations, but you should always restart Blender after updating to a new addon version. Otherwise, the alternate approaches described below also work for installing and updating MACHIN3tools. Verify MACHIN3tools is installed MACHIN3tools Get Support tool in the 3D view's sidebar After a fresh installation , MACHIN3tools will show up under the MACHIN3 tab in the 3D view's sidebar with only the GetSupport tool and Documentation links shown. Note This primarily serves as Installation Verification , and can be disabled in the addon preferences . I do this now, because I've had complaints from people claiming MACHIN3tools is faulty and doesn't install correctly, simply because they expect every addon to always be present in the 3D view's sidebar. MACHIN3tools is a huge addon but only a handful of tools or tool groups are accessible in the sidebar, and all of them need to be activated first - at least in the Prime variant. Set Up MACHIN3tools to your liking After Installation, you should go to the addon preferences and activate the various tools or menus you want to use - or deactivate the ones enabled by default, which in the Prime variant is only the Focus tool and the Modes pie , in an attempt to not overwhelm newcomers. Alternate Installation Methods Fresh Installation If you don't have a previous version of MACHIN3tools installed, you can follow the default installation process from within Blender's preferences in the addons tab, and install from the .zip file. Note May look slightly different depending on your specific Blender version. installation from the Addons tab of Blender's preferences, by selecting the addon's .zip file Update Installation Warning When updating to a new addon version, avoid disabling and uninstalling the previous version, or Blender will forget any custom settings or keymaps you have set! Instead update like described in the video above or using the Integrated Updated or via the Manual Filebrowser Installation . If you do have a previous version installed, and you want to update (or downgrade) to another version, you can use the Integrated MACHIN3tools Updater . Note This is not internet based. You still need to download the .zip file yourself. The benefit of doing this, over disabling and removing the old version from the Blender preferences, is that it will keep any custom settings or keymaps you may have done. Using the integrated updater is very straight forward: Unfold it from the top of the MACHIN3tools addon preferences. Select the MACHIN3tools zip file to install, if it's in your home dir or Downloads folder, it will be found automatically. Verify it's the version you want, and Quit Blender to install the update, otherwise remove it. 3 steps to update: unfold, pick update .zip, quit Blender Manual Filebrowser Installation If you know what you are doing, and know where Blender expects its addons to be installed, you can of course also manually extract the addon's .zip file to the correct location. I recommend against this these days, as the above approaches are less error prone. Special Case: Blender on MacOS MacOS users should install Blender properly, by following the official instructions . Avoid running it just from the Downloads folder! Note that, for dragging of files and folders, you need to hold down the COMMAND key. This will ensure AppTranslocation 1 is avoided. Furthermore, your download may not actually result in a .zip file , and instead extract automatically. This can and needs to be be changed in Safari settings . Special Case: Blender on Arch Linux Arch Linux users and users of other Arch based or similar rolling release distros are advised to use the official Blender builds . The Blender package in the Community repository does not supply its own Python, and does not follow official recommendations . As a consequence, your system's python version may not work properly with Blender and/or MACHIN3tools.

But if you can access Page Up using your mouse, it makes a lot of sense. The Shading Pie is one of the most powerful and most used menus in MACHIN3tools. It allows you to toggle all kinds of shading (viewport and object based) and overlay settings, without having to search for them in menus at the border of the view port, or in the properties panel. Furthermore it facilitates quick shading type switching. Of note here, is that the pie supports overlay toggling per shading type , which means you can have overlays enabled for Solid shading, and have them automatically disabled, when switching to Material shading for instance. Solid Shading shading pie in solid shading, with overlays enabled Material Shading shading pie in eevee powered material shading, with overlays disabled Note The shading pie allows you to adjust Eevee settings (see above) in Material shading, even when Cycles is set as the render engine, which is otherwise not possible natively in Blender. Rendered Shading shading pie in rendered shading, with overlays disabled, and the render engine set to cycles With Cycles as the Renderer the pie allows toggling of an object's shadow caster and holdout props. Shadow Catcher toggle for Active Object in Cycles box of the Shading Pie Wire Shading shading pie in wire shading, with overlays enabled Preferences The shading pie exposes a few preferences . In particular for the Overlay toggling behavior, the Autosmooth tool, the Matcap Switch tool. Tools Shade Smooth in object and edit modes, optionally utilizing the Autosmooth angle + setting sharps based on it Shade Flat in object and edit modes, optionally clearing all sharps Autosmooth Angle Presets Toggle Grid Toggle Wireframe, globally as an overlay, or per object, or in edit mode using XRay to mirror 2.79s wire mode behavior, useful to select through Toggle Object Axes Toggle Cursor Axes Toggle Outline Toggle Cavity Toggle Curvature Toggle Overlays Also: Matcap Switch - cycle between two predetermined matcaps Colorize Materials - set material viewport colors from last node in material Colorize from Active - set object viewport colors from active object Colorize from Materials - set object viewport colors from material Colorize from Collections - set object viewport colors based on collections Colorize from Groups - set object viewport colors based on groups As well as: 180\u00b0 Studio Light Rotation Eevee Presets Bevel Shader toggle - in Rendered Shading Autosmooth As of Blender 4.1, Autosmooth is no longer a mere mesh property , but instead a Modifier . I think this change is very welcome, as it gets rid of some odd legacy Blender behavior. The Shading Pie and its Shade Smooth , Shade Flat and AutoSmooth tools fully support this change and the UX is unchanged compared to previous versions. Autosmooth remains a toggle in the pie, just as if it still were a boolean property . Autosmooth in 4.1+ looks and behaves identical to how it worked in previous Blender versions Under the hood, instead of toggling the mesh.use_auto_snmooth property, MACHIN3tools will add or remove the new geo node Smooth by Angle modifier to enable or disable Auto Smooth. MACHIN3tools will automatically add/remove the mod on unselected-but-instanced objects too. Note Note that the Auto Smooth mod should be kept at or towards the the end of the stack. When MACHIN3tools adds the mod, it will be added at the end, but before any Mirror or Array mods, that may be at the end already. So far this seems like a good general solution. Inevitably we'll probably see use cases, where we may have to manually adjust its position though. Personally, I like that you no longer even need to use AutoSmooth for sharp edges to be considered, and neither when using custom normals. Both just work, as you would expect on any smooth shaded mesh object. Beyond that, I like that we can auto-smooth CURVE objects now, and that it plays well with boolean mods on objects with custom normals, which previously would have their shading messed up. Keep in mind Addons like HardOps, BoxCutter or HyperCursor in pre-release on Patreon , tend do do their own modifier sorting, which can be very useful and avoids having to micro-manage modifier stack order. Using the Shading Pie Blender 4.2 introduced a new version of Eevee called Eevee Next , which brings realtime raytracing, and along with that a completely different way to set things up and tweak it all. The Material Shading parts of the Shading Pie were updated accordingly. As in previous version you can quickly adjust the Eevee settings (which are used in MATERIAL shading too), even when your render engine is set to Cycles. Also as before you have preset buttons at the top of the Eevee box, that allow you to quickly change multiple settings at once. Refer to the tooltips for details. New in Blender 4.2 are user-presets, which can be set from the Properties editor in the Raytracing panel. If you set some of these up for yourself, the Shading Pie will find and expose them for you. Now, your first reaction to this Eevee Next panel may be being overwhelmed, but I assure you it's easier and more efficient than the alternative. The only things you will want to adjust in 99% of the cases are 1. the presets and 2. the thickness value, which is why I chose to highlight it in red. Also, if you look at it with the None preset chosen you will see it's not so bad :) To make life easier, I have combined 6 settings into 3 \"multi-props\". Adjusting Thickness, Resolution, or Precision (Quality) will adjust the natively independent Screen-Trace and Fast GI settings of the same name at the same time. For example, changing resolution from 1:2 to 1:4, will change both the Screen-Trace resolution and the Fast GI resolution accordingly. I've also exposed the Shadow and AO passes directly for quick access. Shadow in particular can be very cool to get a very graphic visual read of a scene or design. Bloom Eevee Next no longer has a Bloom toggle. But the Shading Pie still does! In Blender 4.2, the Bloom toggle of the Shading Pie will set up Bloom via the compositor for you, or toggle it, if it has been set up already. I've thrown in a Dispersion toggle on top of it too. What's cool is, not only are these effects shown and adjustable in realtime, they also work just the same in Cycles! Volumes Similarly, there is no Volume toggle in native Blender, but there is on in the Shading Pie! It does two things, because volumes exist in either of 2 ways: a global world volume set up by nodes in your world volume objects Without volume objects being present, turning on Volume rendering will setup a basic world volume for you, and expose some basic settings in the pie. With volume objects being present, their visibility will be toggled by adjusting viewport filtering. This way individual object visibility states are never touched and changed. If you have volume objects present, but in addition you also want to add a world volume, you can do so by SHIFT clicking on the volume toggle. World More World properties are being exposed now. Blender 4.2 introduced the ability to toggle world shadows, so shadows dynamically created from HDRIs! Cool. You can even soften them by increasing the Sun Angle (size). Also, if you use the scene world, MACHIN3tools will check your world node setup and look for a number of generic property names, such as Rotation or Rotation Z , which - if found - allows you to rotate your world directly from the pie. Also also, if you use the EasyHDRI addon, then know that its node groups are supported too. Recursive Smoothing and Bevel Shader DECALmachine The BevelShader toggle supports Panel Decals of DECALmachine. Conveniently, adjusting the bevel width on the panel decal's parent object, will then automatically set it for separate panel decal object as well.

Smart Pie This update introduces the new Smart pie in Edit Mesh mode. It includes the Smart Vert , Smart Edge , and Smart Face tools, now conveniently accessible through this pie menu and its single keymap. the Smart Pie with Smart Vert, Smart Edge and Smart Face activated This pie should be useful, if you don't use these tools that often, or struggle with their keymaps. For convenience, the tools' keymaps can easily be disabled in the Smart pie's addon preferences, to free-up \"keyboard real-estate\", while still being able to use the tools easily through the pie and it's single keymap - 1 by default and adjustable under the keymaps tab in the preferences. Toggle the Smart Vert, Smart Edge and Smart Face keymaps individually or all at once from the pie's settings in the addon preferences Tool Switcher and Picker The Top button in the Tools pie was so far always reserved for the Select Box tool. However for those who had HyperCursor in pre-release on patreon installed it functioned as a switcher between Select Box and HyperCursor . Now, this \"Tool Switcher\" is fully adjustable in the addon prefs and allows switching or cycling between any tools you want, adjustable in the addon preferences. By default it now switches between Select Box and Move . Use the Top button to switch between Select Box and Move tools by default, or optionally switch or cycle between any number or user-defined tools Customize the tools to switch/cycle between, or make the Top Button invoke the Tools Picker instead Furthermore, ALT clicking on the Top button will invoke the new modal Tool Picker now, which provides quick access to any tool right under the mouse. This avoids having to go to or reveal the tools bar if you prefer to keep it hidden. It's also superior to the native Tools popup menu, because it actually reveals all tools, and allows direct switching to any sub tool in a group of tools. the new modal Tools Picker in object- and edit-mesh-modes The Tool Picker is mapped to SHIFT + Q by default, but that keymap is disabled by default and needs to be enabled, to avoid conflicts with other addons. Alternatively, the Top button itself be be set up to invoke the Tool Picker , without the need for the ALT mod key, thereby replacing the Tool Switcher , Auto Save Auto Save capabilities have been added to the Save pie . Toggle AutoSave from the top left section of the Save Pie, optionally adjust the interval and toggle pre-undo and pre-redo saving right here too It supports sub-minute intervals, down to every 10 seconds, and defaults to 30 seconds. There is an adjustable file count limit for externally auto-saved files, that defaults to 20, thereby creating a history of the past 10 minutes when enabled. By default Auto Save saves externally in a specified folder or in the system's temp dir if none is specified. Optionally you can set it up to self-safe the currently open file too, which means saving it at the path you have previously chosen, or saving the startup file, if you haven't chosen a path yet. Auto Save settings in the addon preferences, with a custom path set Previously you already could already make MACHIN3tools save automatically before undo- or redo-operations - which are both potential triggers for Blender crashes. Saving before this happens safeguards against data loss, and both are now sub-features of Auto-Save with Pre-Undo-Saving enabled by default, and Pre-Redo-Saving disabled. This is how I personally work too. Clicking on the Auto Save button in the pie, while holding ALT or CTRL will open the auto save folder in Blender's or the system's filebrowser, so you can quickly access a previously saved file. Smart Face Smart Face's object creation (from a face selection) has been updated and supports two new \"modes\" now. Previously it always duplicated the selection, but now it can optionally dissolve the selections boundary edges, or extract the faces, which removes them from the original object. choose Duplicate, Dissolve or Extract mode, and optionally stay on the original object There's also an option to Stay on the original object now, instead of going into edit mode for the newly created object. Shorts I've been creating Short videos covering MACHIN3tools, MESHmachine and DECALmachine , on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays accordingly for the past 4 weeks. Below you can see a compilation of the 4 MACHIN3tools clips in a single video, and in landscape format. TODO: MACHIN3tools Shorts compilation video. Check out this Tips and Tricks playlist on youtube, to see the others for MESHmachine and DECALmachine too. more The Collection pie has been updated and among other things now exposes the viewlayer exclusion toggle (for the first layer collection of a collection in the scene). The Workspace pie now syncs the active tool when you switch between original and .alt workspace or when forced via ALT mod key. The Modes pie supports switching into Pose mode, even for Linked Armature objects, when a Library Override is used. The Shading pie now avoids showing some parts that are not relevant when the render engine is BLENDER_WORKBENCH . The Focus tool - when going into Local View now disables Array modifiers, just like it already disabled Mirror modifiers before. Finally, in Blender 4.5 the new Capture Asset Priview tool is exposed in the Assetbrowser's sidebar panel, directly under the asset's thumbnail for convenience. With the Assetbrowser tools enabled, both - Blender's new native tool and MACHIN3tool's own thumbnail creation tool - are exposed. Last but not least, and not a MACHIN3tools but a Blender change - the Note tool is no longer limited by a cap on the size of grease pencil lines, and thereby there is no limit on how small an annotation can be any more in 4.5. As always, check out the changelog for a list of all changes and fixes. 1.12.2 2025-06-11 Tiny bugfix release for the Shading pie and Focus and EditAssembly tools. I'd consider this completely optionally, if you never encountered any issues. See changelog for details. 1.12.1 2025-06-05 Some bugfixes, some tweaks, and some new things, in particular for Blender 4.5 still in beta! . See changelog for details. 1.12 2025-05-21 This is a significant release with major additions to DeusEx too - in particular if you use or intend to use the Assetbrowser tools and the Group tools . If you are in a hurry, you can watch this following quick video going over most of the changes and additions. If you have half an hour, you can watch the following 40 minute video at 1.5x for an overview that goes into more detail. Otherwise, you can also read on and find the specific updates covered below, or head straight to the changelog . Paid Update This 1.12 update is the first paid update - ending my streak of releasing 36 free feature updates over the past 7 years - for MACHIN3tools alone. Updates which have gotten bigger and bigger with each passing year, and this latest one is no exception. In fact MACHIN3tools has outgrown DECALmachine now and its codebase surpasses it, even the Prime variant. It is truly a massive addon , and for what it's worth, I've spent over 2 month full-time, 7 days a week - just on this update. If you bought MACHIN3tools less than a year ago , then this update is still free for you and will download automatically. Otherwise please see the following FAQ entries for details on how paid updates work , if you are out of the free update period, as well as more details on why paid updates are introduced now . It should be very straight forward, I think it's a steal, and I thank you in advance should you choose to continue to support my work \ud83d\ude4f With that out of the way, let's go over the major changes and additions in MACHIN3tools 1.12 now. Asset Browser Tools Assembly Asset Creation now supports severely hidden objects , which are objects in excluded or hidden collections. Assembly Asset Creation now also supports keeping DECALmachine backups or MESHmachine stashes around. These will persist after dropping an asset into a new file after disassembly or when editing an assembly. Also, you can now optionally create Assembly Assets without duplicating the originally selected objects. This is a bit more limited - for instance it doesn't support sub-assembly assets - and in my opinion is more suitable to simple assemblies, but it may suit your workflow better. Sub-Assembly Assets are ones created from part of a larger hierarchy of objects, which is now supported via the Selection Only toggle in the Create Assembly Asset popup. To avoid repetitive tasks, you can now also add tags and metadata at time of asset creation . The DeusEx variant introduces a Thumbnail Helper Gizmo, that offers precise control over the Asset's Thumbnail framing , which can sometimes be off a bit when done automatically, in particular with rotated mirrored objects present within the assembly. DeusEx also allows you to directly introspect and edit any Assembly or Instance Collection. The Assembly Origin is now set relative to the Assembly's empty object, but can optionally still be set relative to the original assembly objects. In addition you can now reset the origin, thereby making the instance collection empty the world origin within the collection. DeuxEx also allows you to change an assembly/instance collection origin's rotation/orientation now - something that Blender itself doesn't support directly, as the instance collection offset only affects translation. Also, instead of adjusting the Assembly Origin from the sidebar, you can now do it from the Cursor and Origin pie as well. In DeusEx , you can now create Assembly Variants to create unique variations of existing assemblies. Also in DeusEx - and particularly useful for Assembly Variants or also any user-created Instance Collection - you can now easily turn them into a local asset with proper thumbnail , and optionally with tags and metadata. Finally, once you are happy and finished with your assets, you can then use the new Clean-out Non-Assets tool, which creates an efficiently small a blend file that contains only the assets and related data. Group Tools Working with Groups (empty parent hierarchies) has been further improved and MACHIN3tools now allows you to visualize Group relationships, by drawing their hierarchy in the 3D View. This is done automatically when entering Group Origin Adjustment Mode or Outliner Group Mode . Group Mode has been improved and among other things now automatically toggles Group Selection Behavior and Group Empty Visibility . Group auto-naming has been improved significantly, and avoids Blender-added index suffixes at the end of a group empty's name, if group suffixes are enabled in the addon preferences . The Select Group tool now behaves differently in Local View , and now automatically brings Group objects into Local View , while avoiding recursive selection, unless forced via the CTRL mod key. Select Hierarchy The Select Hierarchy tool has been completely rewritten and now supports severely hidden objects , which are those in excluded or hidden collections. The HUD and redo panel have been improved and selecting everything in a hierarchy is now quicker than ever. Extrude Tools MACHIN3tools now exposes the Blender-native Extrude menu popup keymap in its addon preferences . Neither the Cursor Spin nor the Punch It tool (in MACHIN3tools) are key-mapped by default, and instead they are accessed either from the native Extrude menu popup, from the 3D view's sidebar, or now also from the native CTRL + F Face context menu. Smart Vert Smart Vert can now merge UVs in Merge Last and Merge Center modes. For now, only in Vert mode however. Smart Face Smart Face introduces a Topo Mode , that allows moving the corner vert of the newly created face, before the selection for the next tool-invocation is prepared. Apply Transform Apply Transform now supports compensating additional modifiers: Displace, Solidify, Weld and Array. Also, the tool can now be accessed directly from the native CTRL + A Apply menu. Material Picker The Material Picker can now pick materials through wire objects. Usually you would have these hidden - at least I do - but now you don't have to. Thread The Thread tool now let's you know if your selection is incorrect. It turns out a few people are box selecting cylinder faces without also selecting the backside's faces, and then wonder why the Thread tool isn't working. Modes Pie The Modes Pie 's button at the top in Object Mode can now be changed to be a Sculpt button, simplifying the switch to Sculpt mode and back. This is optional and legacy behavior can be restored, but it is the new default now, as the Edit mode button is a bit redundant with the direct Mesh Element modes available at the bottom too. With Group tools enabled, you can also choose to show the Group , Ungroup , or Select Group tools at the top of the Modes pie . Also various Group options and settings are exposed here too now, making common Group operations significantly more accessible. For regular empties the pie now exposes some basic options too. And finally, for Assembly empties , the DeusEx variant , exposes the Edit Assembly and Finish Assembly Editing buttons to the Modes Pie . In addition the Assembly Variant and Turn into Asset tools are exposed. And even the Prime Variant exposes Assembly Asset Thumbnail Creation directly in the Modes Pie. Furthermore, if you are sculpting in Blender, you now have quick access to common Sculpt settings such as Symmetry , DynTopo and Remesh . Also, you can now reload an object's linked library directly from the Modes pie . It also offers an extensive tool-tip giving you a comprehensive breakdown of the linked data. Save Pie The Save Pie now indicates unsaved changes, and exposes image operations when invoked in the Image/UV Editor. Also, with the FBX exporter shown, you can now easily toggle the FBX Apply All Scale setting to switch between exporting to Unity or Unreal Engine. Shading Pie The Shading Pie now exposes the Retopology toggle, and the Shade Smooth/Flat tools support severely hidden objects , which are those in excluded or hidden collections. Snapping Pie Last but not least, the Snapping Pie adds a new Snapping Preset : Face Nearest . Also, you can disable the fading HUD now, and customize the Snapping Presets in the addon preferences . more All modal tools now support extra wide key icons in statusbar. This includes Material Picker , Mirror , Note , SmartVert - Slide Extend and the Deus Ex Punch it and Edge Constrained Transform tools. Also, the addon preferences and the 3D view's sidebar now make use of Blender's layout.panel element. There are also new Installation , Get Support and addon preferences videos, that hopefully address all the various Blender issues that can possibly come up, thereby simplifying and streamlining my support process, or eleminating the need for it altogether. The FAQ has been extended and covers more of these issues too, as well as a number of other common questions. In case it's not obvious yet also I've spent significant time roughly 1 month on documenting this update, and updating the various sub-pages of these docs too. This is an ongoing process, and I expect to make more improvements over the coming weeks, including new narrated videos for older tools and features. As always, for a comprehensive overview of all changes , please see the changelog . 1.11.1 2024-11-25 Minor bugfix release, see changelog for details. 1.11 2024-11-09 This \u00eds the Blender 4.3 release, and with that, I'm also raising the minimum version to 4.2 LTS now. Note tool and Grease Pencil v3 One of the major changes in Blender 4.3 is the rewrite of GreasePencil - internally now called v3 . The Modes and Tools pies have been updated to support the new Grease Pencil type in Blender 4.3, and adapt to the API changes accordingly. You would think Grease Pencil is not a major part of MACHIN3tools - and you would be right - but addressing all the changes still took over a week.. However, that also includes a new tool, because I took this opportunity to add a Notes tool, which allows you to easily add text notes anywhere on your model - useful if you don't work with a tablet, or dislike writing by hand. Textual notes are not only useful for yourself - as little reminders or ideas with spacial context - but also when working collaboratively of course. Note The tool works a bit differently in Blender 4.2 vs 4.3, as demonstrated in the video above. In 4.2 it is fully annotation based, and so notes only exist on annotation layers, not as scene objects. In 4.3, this is no longer possible, and I had to resort to creating Grease Pencil objects, that hold the notes. benefits parented to objects easily transform notes afterwards disadvantages clutters scene with GP objects in SOLID Single shading has solid color, not annotation color; may require multiply blend mode to be legible has minimum stroke thickness hard cap, limiting use of small notes With an active Grease Pencil object in draw mode, the Tools pie now exposes the Brush, Line and Erase tools, as well as quick access to the object's Grease Pencil layers and tint color in other modes. Tools pie in GreasePencil draw mode The ToggleAnnotations tool in Blender 4.3 supports toggling layers of Grease Pencil Note objects in 4.3 too now - in addition to regular annotations, thereby creating a consistent 4.2-like experience, and avoiding having to micro-manage Grease Pencil objects. Align The Align tool got some last minute updates. You can now align objects based on the local axes of the active object or the cursor. Furthermore, bone alignment and in-between alignment have been updated and now support setting the relative slide distance. AssetBrowser tools For assembly assets created with MACHIN3tools, you can now adjust the asset origin afterwards in different ways. You can also update thumbnails for other asset types now: objects, collections, materials and poses I think even actions . Finally, when you hold down the ALT key, you can ensure overlays are rendered too, which may be useful when you want an armature to appear on the thumbnail for instance. FileBrowser tools The modal tool used to adjust thumbnail sizes in the file- and asset browsers - invoked via 3 by default - has been extended to support the Asset Shelf too now. As of Blender 4.3, asset shelves are where your brushes for painting, sculpting and grease pencil are accessed from. Also, in the asset browser, selecting the import method is now also a modal operator, that works similarly as adjusting thumbnail sizes: Hold 4 and move the mouse horizontally. Save Pie The Save pie now optionally supports glTF and Better FBX importing and exporting. Each import/export method can be toggled individually in the addon preferences Keep in mind Better FBX is not included in MACHIN3tools Also the Load Next/Previous tools ask for confirmation if the currently open file is unsaved, before prodceeding. Confirm before loading the next/previous file, while the current file is unsaved Snapping Pie In the Snapping pie you can now set snap elements additively, by holding the ALT key. So for instance, you can enable VERTEX and EDGE snapping at the same time. A fading label is drawn whenever you pick a Snap Preset to indicate what exactly is enabled at the current time. Snap elements are also shown at the top of the pie now. Finally, Grid snapping now uses the CLOSEST target, not MEDIAN . more The Material Picker tool can now pick and append materials from assembly assets or collection instancess. The Focus tool in View Selected mode now ignores array modifiers by default. Note Supported right now are Blender's native array modifiers, as well as HyperCursor's geo node based arrays. Support for other 3rd party array mods could be added on request, if you can supply a blend file. The paint and sculpt modes in the Modes pie have been fleshed out some more, and now also show pie buttons for object and edit mesh modes for quick access. Object and Edit Mesh modes access while in Sculpt mode Smart Vert now tries to maintain UVs when center- and last-merging. Smart Edge now supports creasing when invoked via SHIFT + 2 And Smart Face by default now clears modifiers on extracted faces. It now also supports extracting from multiple edit mesh objects at once, and can then optionally join them into a single object too. As always, there is a complete overview of all the changes in the changelog . Enjoy Blender 4.3 and please support my work, if you haven't already... All of this documentation is a lot of additional work, and is free. It eats up a lot of my time and energy, that I'd rather spend developing or making art. So I hope you appreciate it, and thank you for reading this far. 1.10.1 2024-08-05 This is mostly a bug fix release, but not completely. The general focus is on linked assets/data, which is now handled much better, and again less invasive than if you were to use Blender's native make_local operator, which requires the type='ALL' arg to make linked instance collections accessible. That however would make all linked data in the blend file local, which you probably want to avoid. The MakeLocal tool in MACHIN3tools is more targeted to the selection only, and in addition to object data, handles instance_collection data too. See the changelog for complete list of changes and fixes. 1.10 2024-08-01 This is the Blender 4.2 update. This took considerably more time than I initially thought it would, hence the delay and being 2 weeks \"late\". But I hope you agree the delay was worth the wait, and that this is a good one. The 2 major areas of focus in this release are Eevee Next in Blender 4.2, and the AssetBrowser tools which have been completely reworked, offering a simpler UX and better results. AssetBrowser tools Assembly Asset creation is easier than ever. MACHIN3tools will look through an entire parent-child hierarchy and find all relevnt objects in it as well as all mod objects. So your selection for creating the asset can be very simple and doesn't have to encompass all objects. The asset origin/empty can now by placed in the Cursor's location too. Furthermore, the thumbnail can now be updated after the asset is created, and this can be done from the 3D view, or the asset browser. Internally, when an asset is created all the original objects are now being duplicated and so left untouched. This allows me to make some decisions so you don't have to. Duplicated asset objects are then placed in a dedicated asset collection, which itself will be placed in a main _Assets collection. Both will be linked to the scene, but hidden from the viewlayer. Doing it like this is more transparent and allows you to see what is going on. That said, if you want to make a change to an asset it may still be wise to just remove it and re-create it from the original objects instead. Asset collection objects are no longer being moved to the world origin now, and instead the instance_offset is used. Remove Assembly or entire Asset There is a removal tool now, that allows you to remove an assembly asset, and its instance collection in one go, as long as it doesn't have any other users anymore. For local assets, so those stored in the very file you are creating them in, you can also remove the entire asset and any potential instances in one go. Naturally this will remove the asset from the asset browser. Thumbnail Rendering has been overhauled completely. MACHIN3tools will find your asset wherever it is on the 3D view, and frame it perfectly for you. As before, viewport rendering is used, so you can create thumbnails from SOLID shading, or using Eevee in MATERIAL or RENDERED shading. Camera views are supported now, so you can even use effects like Depth of Field, if you want. Furthermore, Cycles is supported as well now, if you chose is as the renderer, in which case still rendering is used automatically. Disassembling an asset, so making the individual asset objects accessible, will now ensure objects and collections are local (not linked), and do so recursively. If objects in the asset are Rigid Bodies , the necessary setup to make that work again will be performed after disassembly. The sidebar panels in both the 3D view and the asset browser will now expose the instance collection name of assembly assets. asset collection names in the sidebar panels Note Since I can either prepend or append to existing Blender panels, the collection name property precedes the actual asset name. The sidebar panel will also list child assets, that are part of a bigger asset of assets, and will do so recursively in a tree-like fashion, should there be multiple levels. Thumbnail Scaling + Local Library Bookmark Scaling thumbnails in the AssetBrowser - keymapped to 3 by default, is now a modal operator, meaning you can interactively scale thubmails by moving the mouse. This works in the FileBrowser too, and you can disable it in the addon prefs for the FileBrowsser tools, should you prefer the legacy behavior which cycled through different sizes. The Bookmarks Bar now comes with a new pseudo-bookmark for the local library, called Current File . It's keymapped to ALT + ^ by default. the Current File pseudo bookmark at the beginning of the asset bookmarks bar Note, that unlike the regular bookmarks, you can not assign a catalog to it, nor a thumbnail size. So instead switching to this bookmark will select the most used catalog in the file, and auto-scale the thumbnails based on the asset browser dimensions. This should ensure that at least something is shown at all, because unfortunately its impossible to select the All catalog via the API. Shading Pie (Eevee Next) Eevee Next is here, brings realtime raytracing, and along with that a completely different way to set things up and tweak it all. As in previous version you can quickly adjust the Eevee settings (which are used in MATERIAL shading too), even when your render engine is set to Cycles. Also as before you have preset buttons at the top of the Eevee box, that allow you to quickly change multiple settings at once. Refer to the tooltips for details. New in Blender 4.2 are user-presets, which can be set from the Properties editor in the Raytracing panel. If you set some of these up for yourself, the Shading Pie will find and expose them for you. Now, your first reaction to this Eevee Next panel may be being overwhelmed, but I assure you it's easier and more efficient than the alternative. The only things you will want to adjust in 99% of the cases are 1. the presets and 2. the thickness value, which is why I chose to highlight it in red. Also, if you look at it with the None preset chosen you will see it's not so bad :) To make life easier, I have combined 6 settings into 3 \"multi-props\". Adjusting Thickness, Resolution, or Precision (Quality) will adjust the natively independent Screen-Trace and Fast GI settings of the same name at the same time. For example, changing resolution from 1:2 to 1:4, will change both the Screen-Trace resolution and the Fast GI resolution accordingly. I've also exposed the Shadow and AO passes directly for quick access. Shadow in particular can be very cool to get a very graphic visual read of a scene or design. Bloom Eevee Next no longer has a Bloom toggle. But the Shading Pie still does! In Blender 4.2, the Bloom toggle of the Shading Pie will set up Bloom via the compositor for you, or toggle it, if it has been set up already. I've thrown in a Dispersion toggle on top of it too. What's cool is, not only are these effects shown and adjustable in realtime, they also work just the same in Cycles! Volumes Similarly, there is no Volume toggle in native Blender, but there is on in the Shading Pie! It does two things, because volumes exist in either of 2 ways: a global world volume set up by nodes in your world volume objects Without volume objects being present, turning on Volume rendering will setup a basic world volume for you, and expose some basic settings in the pie. With volume objects being present, their visibility will be toggled by adjusting viewport filtering. This way individual object visibility states are never touched and changed. If you have volume objects present, but in addition you also want to add a world volume, you can do so by SHIFT clicking on the volume toggle. World More World properties are being exposed now. Blender 4.2 introduced the ability to toggle world shadows, so shadows dynamically created from HDRIs! Cool. You can even soften them by increasing the Sun Angle (size). Also, if you use the scene world, MACHIN3tools will check your world node setup and look for a number of generic property names, such as Rotation or Rotation Z , which - if found - allows you to rotate your world directly from the pie. Also also, if you use the EasyHDRI addon, then know that its node groups are supported too. Views Pie Next, the Views Pie has received some updates. When using Smart Cam to create a new camera from the view, by default the view will now be perfectly matched, which is achieved by matching the render resolution ratio to the view's ratio. Also a camera sensor width of 72 is used, while the current viewport's Field of View is brought over to the camera. When in camera view, you can now easily toggle Depth of Field, and set it up by either adjusting the focus distance directly, by picking an existing focus object, or by creating a new focus empty. Also, when you come back to an existing DoF setup at a later point, you can easily select the focus object from the pie, even it it's hidden or not in local view. A fading HUD has been added to the SmartCam and Next/Prev Cam tools too, for additional hotness user feedback. Save Pie For the Save Pie's export options, you can now define root export folders per-file type in the addon preferences. Beyond that, Purging and Cleaning out the file have both been improved. In 4.2 you can now get a Purge Preview by invoking the tool with the SHIFT mod key. Purging will also remove empty collections now, which Blender's native tool doesn't do, unless they are also unlinked. Tools Pie Due to popular demand, I have brought back the BoxCutter and Hardops integrations, as well as the Surface Draw tool (previously in the Modes pie). The Tools pie with everything enabled There have been improvements for annotations too. Surface placement can now be set via buttons instead of a list, and there is a new tool to toggle annotation visibility across all layers. This visibility toggle will take into account manually hidden annotation layers, and will only re-enable those, that have been previously visible too. Blender 4.2 Pie Menu Conflicts Blender 4.2 sculptors using the Shading and/or Views pies may encounter a keymap conflict due to new native Page Up/Down keymaps for visibility filtering in Sculpt mode. If such a conflict is detected, MACHIN3tools will let you know about it and expose the keymap items, so you can remap them. more The Material Picker now supports multiple open 3D views and AssetBrowsers which is just this simple note here, but took me an entire fucking weekend Also, the Group tool will now indicate and highlight ungroupable objects among the selection, which are those that already are parented so something other than a group empty. The Outliner in Group mode will now truly only show group empties, if you make use of group auto-naming with prefix and/or suffix. Smart Edge can now connect non-manifold vert selections, creating non-manifold edges. Last but not least, the Modes Pie has added Guide mesh < > Final Mesh Editor support, for convenient Dual Mesh Edit mode toggling. As always, for a complete list of all changes, check out the changelog . biggest one yet I think Thanks for your patience and support. Enjoy Blender 4.2. It seems like an amazing release. 1.9 2024-05-23 Material Picker This update brings QOL Quality of Life improvements to the Material Picker tool, that makes it a game changer IMO. At the core of this is the new RIGHTMOUSE keymap for it. Since this likely conflicts with many users' keymap for the context menu, I leave RIGHTMOUSE disabled by default, but I recommend you enable it to try it. There is more info below on how you can make it work for you. You can enable it in two ways: 1. in the General tab of the MACHIN3tools addon preferences Note If you leave it disabled, you can chose to add the Material Picker to the top of the context menu instead! 2. in the Keymaps tab of the MACHIN3tools addon preferences Keep in mind The tool is built in a way to work with RIGHTMOUSE as the keymap to invoke RMB press and finish RMB release the tool. So mapping it to something other than RIGHTMOUSE is not recommended at this point. You are free to add a modifier key however, if you want to keep RIGHTMOUSE exclusively for your context menu. Material Picker Context Note, that even when enabled, RIGHTMOUSE will only ever invoke the Material Picker, if you are in a shading mode, that displays materials, such as MATERIAL or RENDERED shading. It can also invoke in SOLID shading, but only if your have MATERIAL chosen as the color_type . Furthermore, if you don't have a Shader Editor or Asset Browser in the current workspace, while also not having any object or face selection, then Material Picker will also not invoke. In these cases RIGHTMOUSE will be passed through to Blender and do what it would otherwise do, like open the context menu, if that is in your keymap. What does Material Picker actually do? Three things: It picks a material for you to work on in the Shader Editor directly from the 3D view, without you having to select an object and finding the correct material from the object's material stack. It assigns a material to any object or face selection, by picking it from another object in the 3D view. It assigns a material from the asset browser to multiple objects through individual sequential picks, or all at once. This is how that works: Asset Browser tools With the Filebrowser tools active, you can now cycle the display_type in the Assetbrowser as well via the 2 key, again just like in the Filebrowser. You can also cycle the display_type using a dedicated button in the Assetbrowser header, which is most suitable for horizontal layouts however. Changing the display_type is recognized and rembered by the ToggleRegion tool, as well as by the Assetbrowser bookmarks . more As always, there is more in this release, so please refer to the changelog for a complete list of changes. Spring Sale Blendermarket has a Spring Sale going on right now, and you can get all of my addons for 25% off . 1.8 2024-03-22 Pricing and MACHIN3tools Prime With this recent batch of addon updates for Blender 4.1, I've decided to bump the price across most of them a little, and MACHIN3tools is no exception. The Standard variation - previously free on gumroad and github, and sold for $1 on Blender Market, is now history. Prime is now the new base version of MACHIN3tools, and contains ~95% of the feature set compared to DeusEx. On gumroad - where payment was voluntary - unfortunately less than 1% chose to donate or buy DeusEx, and after 6 years, that has simply proven unsustainable. Most people don't realize this, but MACHIN3tools is actually my biggest addon in terms of code base, just after DECALmachine, but before MESHmachine. And so it needs to start carrying its own weight now. I think the new MACHIN3tools pricing - $5 for Prime, $15 for DeusEx - is more than fair and reasonable in the current market environment and with the value that is offered. Gumroad Donators If you have gotten MACHIN3tools Standard on gumroad and have donated $5 or more, you have been bumped to DeusEx already. If you have donated $3.50 or more, then you have been bumped to Prime. These pricing changes aim to counter a general downtrend in revenue, in face of rising living and so development costs, that I have observed for over a year now. The reasons for this are not clear, but it's likely a mix of multiple: post-COVID era reaching market saturation? increased competition lack of new products and social media activity - while my main focus remains on getting HyperCursor out gen AI and waning interest in Blender? inflation layoffs the one we don't talk about For now, I still want to avoid charging for updates, but it may be inevitable. I'll see how it goes. If you found MACHIN3tools Standard useful in the past, I would appreciate it if you would consider upgrading to Prime or even DeusEx now. Thanks for your support, now on to the 1.8 update... Auto Smooth This release brings Blender 4.1 support, which introduced changes to (Auto)Smooth behavior . I think this change is very welcome, as it gets rid of some odd legacy Blender behavior. The Shading Pie and its Smooth, Flat and AutoSmooth tools are most affected by this, but I'm happy to say that its look and UX are unchanged compared to previous versions. Autosmooth in 4.1 looks behaves identical to how it looks in previous Blender versions Under the hood, instead of toggling the mesh.use_auto_snmooth property, MACHIN3tools will add or remove the new geo node Smooth by Angle modifier to enable or disable Auto Smooth. MACHIN3tools will automatically add/remove the mod on unselected-but-instanced objects too. Note Note that the Auto Smooth mod should be kept at or towards the the end of the stack. When MACHIN3tools adds the mod, it will be added at the end, but before any Mirror or Array mods, that may be at the end already. So far this seems like a good general solution. Inevitably we'll probably see use cases, where we may have to manually adjust its position though. Personally I like, that you no longer even need to use Auto Smooth for sharp edges to be considered, and neither when using custom normals. Both just work, as you would expect on any smooth shaded mesh object. Beyond that I like, that we can auto-smooth CURVE objects now, and that it plays well with boolean mods on objects with custom normals, which previously would have their shading messed up. Keep in mind Addons like HardOps, BoxCutter or HyperCursor in pre-release on Patreon , tend do do their own modifier sorting, which can be very useful and avoids having to micro-manage modifier stack order. Asset Browser Bookmarks If you appreciate the Asset Browser, you will love Asset Browser Bookmarks. Bookmarks bar in Asset Browser header, and Library - Catalog shown next to it You can jump to any saved bookmark by clicking on it or by using the ALT + 1 to \u00c0LT + 0 keymaps. You can save any Library + Catalog combination by SHIFT clicking on a number/bookmark. Thumbnail size is saved too by the way. You can clear a bookmark by CTRL clicking on it. This is so convenient to use, and gets even better in combination with the Toggle Region tool , which can pop up an asset browser area at the top and bottom of your 3d view at any time. The bookmarks bar is of course of less use in a vertical setup: However, the shortcuts to recall a bookmark still work without issue. So if you prefer to work like that, you will just have to temporarily widen the asset browser area, and save your bookmarks while you can see it, then shrink it down again. Integrated Updater Keep in mind Since this feature is only introduced now in 1.8, it will only be of use for upcoming releases, so can't be used to install this very 1.8 update yet. I've added a custom updater to the addon preferences. It should be very straight forward to use: Unfold it from the top of the MACHIN3tools preferences. Select the MACHIN3tools zip file to install, if it's in your home dir or Downloads folder, it will be found automatically. Verify it's the version you want, and Quit Blender to install the update, otherwise remove it. 3 steps to update: unfold, pick update .zip, quit Blender Note Installing in this way, has the same benefit as doing a manual update installation in the filebrowser, but without having to do anything in the filebrowser, and without knowing where Blender installs addons. Updating this way ensures you will not loose any settings, you've have made in a previous version, or any custom keymaps you have set. more Please see the changelog for a complete list of all changes in MACHIN3tools 1.8. And if you are actually still reading, note that I have a Patreon account, and HyperCursor is in pre-release with a lot more info and details about that coming soon. 1.7 DeusEx \u2764 The highlight of this release in terms of new features are definitely the advancements of the empty based grouping feature, and in particular Group poses for MACHIN3tools DeusEx. The TransformGroup tool has been overhauled, it's HUD has been fleshed out, and the UX has been optimized, and also supports previewing and recalling the poses of the active group empty. fully fleshed out HUD, with the second pose being previewed Poses are simply stored group empty transformations. The focus here, and for now, is only the rotation component Translation may come in future . Scrolling the mouse wheel while the TransformGroup tool is active, allows for easy pose selection and preview, while recalling a selected pose is done simply by releasing the left mouse button. if you want to skip recalling a pose, while having one previewed - perhaps to compare to the current rotation to it - you can finish the tool with the Space key. There is also a new tool dedicated to setting up group gizmos directly from the 3D view, instead of doing it from the sidebar. It conveniently supports view-based axis toggling using the TAB key, so you don't even have to know which rotational axis (in terms of local X,Y or Z) you want to have a gizmo for. Just align your view and press TAB to toggle the most aligned of the 3 axes. All a group empty's poses, are also shown in the sidebar panel. Here they can be renamed, sorted, recalled, and removed. the updated sidebar panel with pose information, even while gizmos are hidden New in 1.7 is also the idea of BatchPoses . They are simply individual poses across different group empties in the same group hierarchy, that are related to eachother. They share a unique name in are indicated using the \ud83d\udd17 icon. You can create them using the SetBatchPose tool, which will create a pose of the current group empty rotations for the currently active empty, and all empties below it in the hierarchy. Single- and BatchPoses can be renamed by double clicking on them in the pose list. Recalling a BatchPose will recall each individual pose of the batch. By default only going down the hierarchy from the active group empty, but optionally also going up. Individual poses can also be temporarily unlinked from the rest of the batch. I think this is all very exciting stuff, and I'm looking forward to hear your feedback! Addon Conflicts + Blender Crashes Over the past months a few users and developers reported conflicts with other addons. These would present themselves as slow performance, such as when rotating a group, or even Blender crashes. In particular ZenUV and ZenSets, as well as GridModeller, Archipack and NodeTreeStore were affected. These issues should now be resolved, by delaying execution of handler logic to a later, safer state. Thanks to Alex ZenUV and Stephen Archipack for your help and suggestions, and thanks to kushiro GridModeller for his patience with this too :) Select Hierarchy Select Hierarchy now supports selecting a parent-child hierarchy up as well. I've added a fading HUD, which is used to indicate if the top or bottom of a hierarchy is reached, and optionally if there are hidden parents or children left. Selecting up and down the hierarchy until the top and bottom of the hierarchy is reached This tool aims to fully replace Blender's native Select Parent/Child tools, and comes with additional features, such as the ability to unhide children and parents, including recursively. Seleciing down, then up, then reaching top with hidden parent, selecting further up with unhide feature, and finally recursively selecting down and unhiding Toggle Region Toggle Region now works in all node editors and in the Image/UV editor, to toggle either the tool bar or the side bar with a single T key. Toggle tool bar or sidebar in node editor via single T keymap Shading Pie The BevelShader toggle has been improved and will in Blender 4 also connect to the Coat Normal inputs. Furthermore it now works for DECALmachien panel decals as well. Conveniently, adjusting the bevel with on the panel decal's parent object, will automatically set it for the panel decal as well. Bevel Shader on DECALmachine's panel decals, with different per-object width modulations Finally, the Cycles box now allows toggling of an object's shadow caster and holdout props. Shadow Catcher toggle for Active Object in Cycles box of the Shading Pie more And as always, for a comprehensive list of all changes, please see the changelog . 1.6 This is the Blender 4.0 compatibility release. Toggle Region Besides a number of tweaks and fixes, MACHIN3tools 1.6 adds the new Toggle Region tool. It - via a single T keymap - allows you to toggle the Toolbar, Sidebar and 2 Asset Browsers (or one Asset Shelf and one Asset Browser) per-3D view. Note The new asset shelf in Blender 4.0, is not very useful yet, and so toggling that is disabled by default. It can can be used in combination with the Pose Library addon apparently though, but not so much for bringing in external assets. More interesting than the shelf however, is the ability to toggle a new asset browser area at the top or bottom of the 3D view. Almost all the tweaks to the layout of the asset browser you can make, are then remembered when closing the asset browser, and restored when opening it again. See the changelog for a full list of changes. 1.5 Blender 3.6 - a new LTS release is releasing, and it finally allows for the complete removal of the legacy bgl module. Beyond the bgl removal, there are a few smaller tweaks, such the ability to have the Material Picker show up based on the view's shading.type , not just based workspace name. Modal HUDs have been improved and now respect the system UI scaling, and timer based modals are now extremely reliable and not longer suffer from occasional speed ups. See the changelog for a list of all changes 1.4.1 A tiny bugfix release to fix Cursor and Origin to edge alignment. Sorry. 1.4 Like the previous 1.3 this release is full of various additions and improvements to simplify your life. Please see the changelog for the full list of changes. 1.3 This release brings a nunmber of quality of life improvements, some fixes, and continued HyperCursor integration. HyperCursor is in pre-release on Patreon since Christmas Eve. See the changelog for details. Happy New Year! 1.2 Version 1.2 mostly fixes some issues, but it also add the SelectHierarchy tool, expands on the previously revamped object axes drawing with the Shading Pie, and extends the object import/export options of the Save Pie. Select Hierarchy Select Hierarchy is a simple tool to effectively select the children of any object in the selection. Save Pie - import/export You can now import/export .usd files from the Save Pie, in addition to .obj and .fbx . All three object types can now also be toggle from the addon preferences . Furthermore, .obj import/export now also supports the new experimental importer/exporter, once you disable the Wavefront OBJ format addon. .usd files can now be imported/exported and all 3 formats can be toggled in the addon prefs Shading Pie - draw object axes The object axes for the active or any object with the Axes toggle set, can now be drawn in screen space, thereby enforcing a fixed size independent on an object's location in 3d space. axes drawn in screen space will always appear at the same size With Cycles as the renderer and the viewport in Render mode, you can now also enabled Denoising from the Shading Pie. more Checkout the changelog for a list of all the additions, changes and fixes in 1.2. 1.1 This update brings a number of improvements across the board. The biggest change is easily the introduction of a modal frontend for the Mirror tool, which enables flick mirroring akin to flick symmetrize in MESHmachine . Another useful change is the ability to easily create assets , without them being located in the world origin. The empty for the collection instance, is now automatically positioned at the averaged location of the selected objects, and offset to the floor. Alternatively you can position it just averaged, or at the world origin (previous behavior). DeusEx users should know, that the Group Transform tool now supports auto-keying, which can be initiated using the K key. Furthermore, there's support for the new Hair/Curve sculpting from the Modes Pie , and the object axes display from the Shading Pie has been completely reworked, making it much more usable. Oh, the Workspace Pie can now be completely customized from the addon prefs. For details on all changes, please see the changelog . 1.0.2 The tiniest of bugfix releases. It just avoids light visibility/renderability synching, if the render tools aren't actually enabled. And it fixes a few typos brought to my attention by an awesome Chinese translator. 1.0.1 A small, quick bugfix release. It turned out the AlignRelative tool in the standard version was out of sync (and not recent) with the DeusEx version. That is fixed now. Also, the CreateAssemblyAsset tool had some issues on Windows, where the generated thumbnail could potentially not be saved. The thumbnail is now (temporarily) stored in the addon folder, and assigned to the asset automatically. 1.0 6 years in the making Work on MACHIN3tools has been going on fairly continuously for almost 6 years now. And what a time it has been. I've switched to Blender 2.77 (from Modo) in spring 2016, when I saw amazing things happening in its addon ecosytem. I was blown away by HardOps, RetopoFlow and Wazou's pie menus in particular. And I have never looked back since. I had started learning Python at the very beginning of 2016. Around summer, I started exploring Blender's API, which lead to a loose collection of various separate scripts. Towards the end of the year I've put them on github. under the name MACHIN3tools following the tradition of Looptools, Edgetools and MiraTools. Towards the end of 2018, When Blender 2.80 became increasingly usable, ~6 months before its release, I had a good reason and opportunity to bring them all together in a single, modular, customizable package which was the 0.3 release. 28 releases later and we are here now - 1.0 My thanks go out to everyone who has come along for the ride, everyone who has offered feedback, encouragement and support. Thank you so much! And my deepest gratitude goes to those, who have inspired me, artistically and technically. Blender is in great shape with the recent 3.1 release, and I feel so is MACHIN3tools 1.0. I'm happy what it has become, and I hope you will find it as useful as I do. Documentation Version 1.0 is now fully documented - well kind of. It's not on the level of the DECALmachine and MESHmachine docs, due to MACHIN3tools being mostly free, but the Deus Ex version and recently Patreon Thanks Guys and Girls! has allowed me to finally spend a few weeks on documenting. Every tool and every pie menu, that you can activate in the addon preferences , has its own entry in the navbar to the left, and I'd invite you to explore this. If you have specific questions about anything in the docs, that you feel is unclear or lacking, feel free to ask for more information and I'll try to expand on it. Groups Groups were added in the beginning of 2021 and have quickly become one of my favourite features of MACHIN3tools. I use them for everything now. So it's about time they are documented too. Align Relative 1.0 brings a new Align tool, that can be extremely useful in some situations. Asset Browser Blender's new Asset Browser is fantastic. Let's make it more useful . A big thank you to Rachel Frick for the BoxBot inspiration. Render In preparation for this release, and as a content source, I have allowed myself to do some personal design work again, which resulted in a few Render tools . These tools are a direct, albeit delayed response to friction in my rendering workflow, that I encountered with the Humanoid Mecha . Punch It Punch It is finally here in Deus Ex. Although a simple version is also available in the Standard version. Note This video is taken from the PUNCHit documentation The tool in MACHIN3tools behaves exactly the same, however it's only accessible from the Extrude Menu, and there is no shortcut set for it. More Check out the changelog for more additions and changes. 0.10 This is an unplanned release, adding only the Assemble Collection tool, which is accessed from the Modes Pie , while a Collection Instance is selected. This is especially useful for Collection Instance Assets , which is currently the only way to use the Asset Browser with Object Assemblies . box bot design inspired by Rachel Frick This supports linked and appended collection instance assets. It supports empty hierarchies and so MACHIN3tools' groups. And it also supports DECALmachine's Decal backups and MESHmachine's Stashes . Oh, I also have a Patreon account now, where I will do pre-releases of upcoming addons, and where I share blend files , if I manage to find time for art. So if you are interested in further supporting my work, that would be a good way to do it. It is very much appreciated! Thank you for considering! 0.9 This release touches on a number of areas, so there should be something for everybody here. ScreenCast The biggest addition is clearly the ScreenCast tool - accessed from the Save Pie. It is - like most things I do - primarily driven by my own needs, but I think others will also appreciate it. The focus of this tool is not on screen casting the keys a user presses, but the tools that are actually run - whether they are called via shortcut or from a menu. This includes a history of the last 12 (adjustable) operators. I find this is much more important - and I imagine it's much more useful to new users - when watching somebody else working. Custom shortcuts are huge in 3D apps, and people shouldn't obsess about what key was pressed at a specific time. ScreenCast tool at the bottom left, Screencast Keys addon (custom fork) at the bottom right That said, if you have the Screencast Keys addon enabled, the MACHIN3tools ScreenCast tool will enable it, so both can run in parallel. Note, that they won't always be in sync. Not every tool will be called via a shortcut, and not every key press will call a tool. Keep in mind While the Screencast Keys addon can catch key presses in modal operators, if that is enabled in its preferences, it won't catch key presses in menus. For instance, toggling the Grid in MACHIN3tools' Shading Pie via PageUp + G will only show up as PageUp . Save Pie In addition to the ScreenCast tool, there's another addition to the Save Pie: The ReloadLinkedLibraries tool. * Thanks to TitusLVR for this contribution!* Snapping Pie The Snapping Pie now comes in 2 layouts, with the new one having the option for Absolute Grid Snapping . You can switch between the two directly from the pie itself, or from the addon preferences. the two layouts - one with grid snapping - can be toggled using the button at the top right Collection Pie You can now add and move objects to collections, while in local/focus mode. Yep. Smart Vert Smart Vert now supports CENTER merging ( SHIFT + 1 ) edge and face selections. Edges will be merged per sequence (connected edges), and faces per island (connected faces). Similarly Smart Vert now also supports LAST merging ( 1 ) edge(sequences) and face(islands) selections. Note however that edge and face selections won't have a LAST(active) vertice. Instead the mouse is used to roughly point at the vert you want to merge to. In SlideExtend mode ( SHIFT + ALT + 1 ) you can now enable the Flatten option using the F key. This means you can skip using MESHmachine's Flatten tool right after, if you want to create a planar face at the end. SlideExtend snapping has been updated to use a more generalized approach, initially developed for HyperCursor (unreleased). The UX remains unchanged. Smart Edge With this version SmartEdge not only supports selection conversion ( 2 ) to Bounds/Region as it used to do, but also selecting Adjacent Edges or Faces. As with Bounds/Region, the initial selection type determines the result. An Edge Selection will be turned into a Face Selection, and a Face Selection will be turned into an Edge Selection. The latter is also possible natively by CTRL switching to Face mode! In previous versions you could use SmartEdge via SHIFt + 2 to toggle edge selections Sharp . Now you can alternatively also create bevel-mod-based Chamfers and Korean Bevels , using the same shortcut. Filebrowser tools There's a new filebrowser tool mapped to 3 to cycle through thumbnail sizes. Toggle Hidden Files has been remapped to 4 accordingly. Toggle Sorting 1 , Toggle Display 2 and Cycle Thumbnails 3 HUD prefs In the addon preferences, you can now adjust the size of text drawn by various tools with H ead U p D isplays, such as Clean Up , Clipping Toggle , Transform Edge Constrained , Focus , Group , Material Picker , Surface Slide and the Tools Pie . For tools with fading HUDs you can adjust the fade time accordingly. And if you want lines drawn by SmartVert: SlideExtend to be anti-aliased, you need to enable Use Legacy Line Smoothing in the View3D section. more There's more, and you can check it out in the changelog . 0.8 Deus Ex MACHIN3tools has always been about simple tools to supplement, tweak, improve or fix Blender behavior and usability. Simple in terms of usability, but also implementation. Despite considerable development time spent on the entire tool and menu set over the years, it has always been free 1 , and that won't change. However, version 0.8 introduces the Edge Constrained Transform . And while this tool is simple to use, it's implementation is far more complex than any other tool in MACHIN3tools. It's more complex than almost all MESHmachine and DECALmachine tools. It's a tool, that in terms of development effort could have gone into MESHmachine , but it doesn't really fit into that tool set, and it's too basic in terms of usability. It could be it's own addon, but that seems inconvenient for me and you. That's why I feel like it's warranted to introduce a low-priced-but-paid-nonetheless MACHIN3tools version called Deus Ex . For now, the only difference to the Standard version is the additional Edge Constrained Transform tool. In future this may change. Since this tool required the implementation of a rotation and scale transformation tool from the ground up, it opens up a number of transform related opportunities in regards to where this could be taken. Note Users who have donated the suggested price of 3.50+ in the past, will receive a full discount for MACHIN3tools Deus Ex. If you haven't received yours yet, get in touch via email . Standard A new addition in 0.8 is the ToggleSmooth tool, which on a key press 2 turns a flat shaded object into a smooth shaded object. It supports two workflows - Korean Bevel and SubD (if a subd mod is present), works in edit mode and supports multi-object selections in object mode. * Korean Bevel Smoothing, by default Overlays are toggled as well* * SubD Smoothing of a single mesh, and entire groups, by default Overlays are not changed* The Cleanup tool, now features a fading HUD, informing you what, if any, geometry has been removed. Finally, SmartVert's SlideExtend feature has been enhanced twofold, which you can see demoed in this tweet . You can now slide/extend from edge mode, in which case the mouse position is used to determine, which vert - so which side of an edge - is extend. Edge snapping has been supported since version 0.5. Now you can snap to faces as well. Note, that snapping here works for all edit mesh objects. Check out the changelog for details on all changes. Thanks to everyone who has supported MACHIN3tools in the past, may it be through comments, suggestions, recommendations, ratings or donations. I appreciate it, and hope you can consider supporting the Deus Ex version too. Blender Market has a minimum price requirement, but let's agree, that 1 USD is still essentially free.

Assembly Asset Creation now also supports keeping DECALmachine backups or MESHmachine stashes around. These will persist after dropping an asset into a new file after disassembly or when editing an assembly. Also, you can now optionally create Assembly Assets without duplicating the originally selected objects. This is a bit more limited - for instance it doesn't support sub-assembly assets - and in my opinion is more suitable to simple assemblies, but it may suit your workflow better. Sub-Assembly Assets are ones created from part of a larger hierarchy of objects, which is now supported via the Selection Only toggle in the Create Assembly Asset popup. To avoid repetitive tasks, you can now also add tags and metadata at time of asset creation . The DeusEx variant introduces a Thumbnail Helper Gizmo, that offers precise control over the Asset's Thumbnail framing , which can sometimes be off a bit when done automatically, in particular with rotated mirrored objects present within the assembly. DeusEx also allows you to directly introspect and edit any Assembly or Instance Collection. The Assembly Origin is now set relative to the Assembly's empty object, but can optionally still be set relative to the original assembly objects. In addition you can now reset the origin, thereby making the instance collection empty the world origin within the collection. DeuxEx also allows you to change an assembly/instance collection origin's rotation/orientation now - something that Blender itself doesn't support directly, as the instance collection offset only affects translation. Also, instead of adjusting the Assembly Origin from the sidebar, you can now do it from the Cursor and Origin pie as well. In DeusEx , you can now create Assembly Variants to create unique variations of existing assemblies. Also in DeusEx - and particularly useful for Assembly Variants or also any user-created Instance Collection - you can now easily turn them into a local asset with proper thumbnail , and optionally with tags and metadata. Finally, once you are happy and finished with your assets, you can then use the new Clean-out Non-Assets tool, which creates an efficiently small a blend file that contains only the assets and related data.","title":"Asset Browser Tools"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#group-tools","text":"Working with Groups (empty parent hierarchies) has been further improved and MACHIN3tools now allows you to visualize Group relationships, by drawing their hierarchy in the 3D View.

You would think Grease Pencil is not a major part of MACHIN3tools - and you would be right - but addressing all the changes still took over a week.. However, that also includes a new tool, because I took this opportunity to add a Notes tool, which allows you to easily add text notes anywhere on your model - useful if you don't work with a tablet, or dislike writing by hand. Textual notes are not only useful for yourself - as little reminders or ideas with spacial context - but also when working collaboratively of course. Note The tool works a bit differently in Blender 4.2 vs 4.3, as demonstrated in the video above. In 4.2 it is fully annotation based, and so notes only exist on annotation layers, not as scene objects. In 4.3, this is no longer possible, and I had to resort to creating Grease Pencil objects, that hold the notes. benefits parented to objects easily transform notes afterwards disadvantages clutters scene with GP objects in SOLID Single shading has solid color, not annotation color; may require multiply blend mode to be legible has minimum stroke thickness hard cap, limiting use of small notes With an active Grease Pencil object in draw mode, the Tools pie now exposes the Brush, Line and Erase tools, as well as quick access to the object's Grease Pencil layers and tint color in other modes.

That however would make all linked data in the blend file local, which you probably want to avoid.

The 2 major areas of focus in this release are Eevee Next in Blender 4.2, and the AssetBrowser tools which have been completely reworked, offering a simpler UX and better results.","title":"1.10"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#assetbrowser-tools_1","text":"Assembly Asset creation is easier than ever. MACHIN3tools will look through an entire parent-child hierarchy and find all relevnt objects in it as well as all mod objects. So your selection for creating the asset can be very simple and doesn't have to encompass all objects. The asset origin/empty can now by placed in the Cursor's location too. Furthermore, the thumbnail can now be updated after the asset is created, and this can be done from the 3D view, or the asset browser. Internally, when an asset is created all the original objects are now being duplicated and so left untouched. This allows me to make some decisions so you don't have to. Duplicated asset objects are then placed in a dedicated asset collection, which itself will be placed in a main _Assets collection. Both will be linked to the scene, but hidden from the viewlayer. Doing it like this is more transparent and allows you to see what is going on. That said, if you want to make a change to an asset it may still be wise to just remove it and re-create it from the original objects instead. Asset collection objects are no longer being moved to the world origin now, and instead the instance_offset is used. Remove Assembly or entire Asset There is a removal tool now, that allows you to remove an assembly asset, and its instance collection in one go, as long as it doesn't have any other users anymore. For local assets, so those stored in the very file you are creating them in, you can also remove the entire asset and any potential instances in one go. Naturally this will remove the asset from the asset browser. Thumbnail Rendering has been overhauled completely. MACHIN3tools will find your asset wherever it is on the 3D view, and frame it perfectly for you. As before, viewport rendering is used, so you can create thumbnails from SOLID shading, or using Eevee in MATERIAL or RENDERED shading. Camera views are supported now, so you can even use effects like Depth of Field, if you want. Furthermore, Cycles is supported as well now, if you chose is as the renderer, in which case still rendering is used automatically. Disassembling an asset, so making the individual asset objects accessible, will now ensure objects and collections are local (not linked), and do so recursively. If objects in the asset are Rigid Bodies , the necessary setup to make that work again will be performed after disassembly. The sidebar panels in both the 3D view and the asset browser will now expose the instance collection name of assembly assets. asset collection names in the sidebar panels Note Since I can either prepend or append to existing Blender panels, the collection name property precedes the actual asset name. The sidebar panel will also list child assets, that are part of a bigger asset of assets, and will do so recursively in a tree-like fashion, should there be multiple levels.","title":"AssetBrowser tools"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#thumbnail-scaling-local-library-bookmark","text":"Scaling thumbnails in the AssetBrowser - keymapped to 3 by default, is now a modal operator, meaning you can interactively scale thubmails by moving the mouse. This works in the FileBrowser too, and you can disable it in the addon prefs for the FileBrowsser tools, should you prefer the legacy behavior which cycled through different sizes. The Bookmarks Bar now comes with a new pseudo-bookmark for the local library, called Current File . It's keymapped to ALT + ^ by default. the Current File pseudo bookmark at the beginning of the asset bookmarks bar Note, that unlike the regular bookmarks, you can not assign a catalog to it, nor a thumbnail size. So instead switching to this bookmark will select the most used catalog in the file, and auto-scale the thumbnails based on the asset browser dimensions. This should ensure that at least something is shown at all, because unfortunately its impossible to select the All catalog via the API.","title":"Thumbnail Scaling + Local Library Bookmark"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#shading-pie-eevee-next","text":"Eevee Next is here, brings realtime raytracing, and along with that a completely different way to set things up and tweak it all. As in previous version you can quickly adjust the Eevee settings (which are used in MATERIAL shading too), even when your render engine is set to Cycles. Also as before you have preset buttons at the top of the Eevee box, that allow you to quickly change multiple settings at once. Refer to the tooltips for details. New in Blender 4.2 are user-presets, which can be set from the Properties editor in the Raytracing panel. If you set some of these up for yourself, the Shading Pie will find and expose them for you. Now, your first reaction to this Eevee Next panel may be being overwhelmed, but I assure you it's easier and more efficient than the alternative. The only things you will want to adjust in 99% of the cases are 1. the presets and 2. the thickness value, which is why I chose to highlight it in red. Also, if you look at it with the None preset chosen you will see it's not so bad :) To make life easier, I have combined 6 settings into 3 \"multi-props\". Adjusting Thickness, Resolution, or Precision (Quality) will adjust the natively independent Screen-Trace and Fast GI settings of the same name at the same time. For example, changing resolution from 1:2 to 1:4, will change both the Screen-Trace resolution and the Fast GI resolution accordingly. I've also exposed the Shadow and AO passes directly for quick access. Shadow in particular can be very cool to get a very graphic visual read of a scene or design.","title":"Shading Pie (Eevee Next)"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#bloom","text":"Eevee Next no longer has a Bloom toggle.

It does two things, because volumes exist in either of 2 ways: a global world volume set up by nodes in your world volume objects Without volume objects being present, turning on Volume rendering will setup a basic world volume for you, and expose some basic settings in the pie. With volume objects being present, their visibility will be toggled by adjusting viewport filtering. This way individual object visibility states are never touched and changed. If you have volume objects present, but in addition you also want to add a world volume, you can do so by SHIFT clicking on the volume toggle.","title":"Volumes"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#world","text":"More World properties are being exposed now. Blender 4.2 introduced the ability to toggle world shadows, so shadows dynamically created from HDRIs! Cool. You can even soften them by increasing the Sun Angle (size). Also, if you use the scene world, MACHIN3tools will check your world node setup and look for a number of generic property names, such as Rotation or Rotation Z , which - if found - allows you to rotate your world directly from the pie. Also also, if you use the EasyHDRI addon, then know that its node groups are supported too.","title":"World"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#views-pie","text":"Next, the Views Pie has received some updates. When using Smart Cam to create a new camera from the view, by default the view will now be perfectly matched, which is achieved by matching the render resolution ratio to the view's ratio. Also a camera sensor width of 72 is used, while the current viewport's Field of View is brought over to the camera. When in camera view, you can now easily toggle Depth of Field, and set it up by either adjusting the focus distance directly, by picking an existing focus object, or by creating a new focus empty. Also, when you come back to an existing DoF setup at a later point, you can easily select the focus object from the pie, even it it's hidden or not in local view.

There is more info below on how you can make it work for you. You can enable it in two ways: 1. in the General tab of the MACHIN3tools addon preferences Note If you leave it disabled, you can chose to add the Material Picker to the top of the context menu instead! 2. in the Keymaps tab of the MACHIN3tools addon preferences Keep in mind The tool is built in a way to work with RIGHTMOUSE as the keymap to invoke RMB press and finish RMB release the tool.

The Standard variation - previously free on gumroad and github, and sold for $1 on Blender Market, is now history. Prime is now the new base version of MACHIN3tools, and contains ~95% of the feature set compared to DeusEx. On gumroad - where payment was voluntary - unfortunately less than 1% chose to donate or buy DeusEx, and after 6 years, that has simply proven unsustainable. Most people don't realize this, but MACHIN3tools is actually my biggest addon in terms of code base, just after DECALmachine, but before MESHmachine. And so it needs to start carrying its own weight now. I think the new MACHIN3tools pricing - $5 for Prime, $15 for DeusEx - is more than fair and reasonable in the current market environment and with the value that is offered. Gumroad Donators If you have gotten MACHIN3tools Standard on gumroad and have donated $5 or more, you have been bumped to DeusEx already. If you have donated $3.50 or more, then you have been bumped to Prime. These pricing changes aim to counter a general downtrend in revenue, in face of rising living and so development costs, that I have observed for over a year now. The reasons for this are not clear, but it's likely a mix of multiple: post-COVID era reaching market saturation? increased competition lack of new products and social media activity - while my main focus remains on getting HyperCursor out gen AI and waning interest in Blender? inflation layoffs the one we don't talk about For now, I still want to avoid charging for updates, but it may be inevitable. I'll see how it goes. If you found MACHIN3tools Standard useful in the past, I would appreciate it if you would consider upgrading to Prime or even DeusEx now.

I think this change is very welcome, as it gets rid of some odd legacy Blender behavior. The Shading Pie and its Smooth, Flat and AutoSmooth tools are most affected by this, but I'm happy to say that its look and UX are unchanged compared to previous versions. Autosmooth in 4.1 looks behaves identical to how it looks in previous Blender versions Under the hood, instead of toggling the mesh.use_auto_snmooth property, MACHIN3tools will add or remove the new geo node Smooth by Angle modifier to enable or disable Auto Smooth. MACHIN3tools will automatically add/remove the mod on unselected-but-instanced objects too. Note Note that the Auto Smooth mod should be kept at or towards the the end of the stack. When MACHIN3tools adds the mod, it will be added at the end, but before any Mirror or Array mods, that may be at the end already. So far this seems like a good general solution. Inevitably we'll probably see use cases, where we may have to manually adjust its position though. Personally I like, that you no longer even need to use Auto Smooth for sharp edges to be considered, and neither when using custom normals. Both just work, as you would expect on any smooth shaded mesh object. Beyond that I like, that we can auto-smooth CURVE objects now, and that it plays well with boolean mods on objects with custom normals, which previously would have their shading messed up. Keep in mind Addons like HardOps, BoxCutter or HyperCursor in pre-release on Patreon , tend do do their own modifier sorting, which can be very useful and avoids having to micro-manage modifier stack order.","title":"Auto Smooth"},{"location":"whatsnew.html#asset-browser-bookmarks","text":"If you appreciate the Asset Browser, you will love Asset Browser Bookmarks.

This is so convenient to use, and gets even better in combination with the Toggle Region tool , which can pop up an asset browser area at the top and bottom of your 3d view at any time. The bookmarks bar is of course of less use in a vertical setup: However, the shortcuts to recall a bookmark still work without issue.

There is also a new tool dedicated to setting up group gizmos directly from the 3D view, instead of doing it from the sidebar. It conveniently supports view-based axis toggling using the TAB key, so you don't even have to know which rotational axis (in terms of local X,Y or Z) you want to have a gizmo for.

You can now slide/extend from edge mode, in which case the mouse position is used to determine, which vert - so which side of an edge - is extend. Edge snapping has been supported since version 0.5. Now you can snap to faces as well. Note, that snapping here works for all edit mesh objects. Check out the changelog for details on all changes.
