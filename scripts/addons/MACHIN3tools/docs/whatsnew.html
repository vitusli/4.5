<h3 id="smart-pie">Smart Pie</h3>
<p>This update introduces the new <a href="pie_smart.html">Smart pie</a> in <em>Edit Mesh</em> mode. It includes the <a href="smart_vert.html">Smart Vert</a>, <a href="smart_edge.html">Smart Edge</a>, and <a href="smart_face.html">Smart Face</a> tools, now conveniently accessible through this pie menu and its single keymap. </p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/smart_pie.png"><img alt="PieSmart" src="img/whatsnew/smart_pie.png" /></a>
<em>the Smart Pie with Smart Vert, Smart Edge and Smart Face activated</em></p>
<p>This pie should be useful, if you don't use these tools that often, or struggle with their keymaps.<br />
For convenience, the tools' keymaps can easily be disabled in the Smart pie's addon preferences, to free-up "keyboard real-estate", while still being able to use the tools easily through the pie and it's single keymap - <code>1</code> by default and adjustable under the keymaps tab in the preferences.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/smart_pie_preferences.png"><img alt="PieSmartPreferences" src="img/whatsnew/smart_pie_preferences.png" /></a>
<em>Toggle the Smart Vert, Smart Edge and Smart Face keymaps individually or all at once from the pie's settings in the addon preferences</em></p>
<h3 id="tool-switcher-and-picker">Tool Switcher and Picker</h3>
<p>The Top button in the Tools pie was so far always reserved for the <em>Select Box</em> tool.<br />
However for those who had HyperCursor<sup>in pre-release on patreon</sup> installed it functioned as a switcher between <em>Select Box</em> and <em>HyperCursor</em>.</p>
<p>Now, this "Tool Switcher" is fully adjustable in the addon prefs and allows switching or cycling between any tools you want, adjustable in the addon preferences.<br />
By default it now switches between <em>Select Box</em> and <em>Move</em>.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_switcher.png"><img alt="ToolsPieSwitcher" src="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_switcher.png" /></a>
<em>Use the Top button to switch between Select Box and Move tools by default, or optionally switch or cycle between any number or user-defined tools</em></p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_switcher_prefs.png"><img alt="ToolsPieSwitcherPreferences" src="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_switcher_prefs.png" /></a>
<em>Customize the tools to switch/cycle between, or make the Top Button invoke the Tools Picker instead</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>ALT</code> clicking on the Top button will invoke the new modal <em>Tool Picker</em> now, which provides quick access to any tool right under the mouse.<br />
This avoids having to go to or reveal the tools bar if you prefer to keep it hidden.  </p>
<p>It's also superior to the native Tools popup menu, because it actually reveals all tools, and allows direct switching to any sub tool in a group of tools.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_picker.png"><img alt="ToolsPiePicker" src="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_picker.png" /></a>
<em>the new modal Tools Picker in object- and edit-mesh-modes</em></p>
<p>The Tool Picker is mapped to <code>SHIFT + Q</code> by default, but that keymap is disabled by default and needs to be enabled, to avoid conflicts with other addons.
Alternatively, the Top button itself be be set up to invoke the <em>Tool Picker</em>, without the need for the <code>ALT</code> mod key, thereby replacing the <em>Tool Switcher</em>,</p>
<h3 id="auto-save">Auto Save</h3>
<p><em>Auto Save</em> capabilities have been added to the <a href="pie_save.html">Save pie</a>.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/save_pie_autosave.png"><img alt="SavePieAutoSave" src="img/whatsnew/save_pie_autosave.png" /></a>
<em>Toggle AutoSave from the top left section of the Save Pie, optionally adjust the interval and toggle pre-undo and pre-redo saving right here too</em></p>
<p>It supports sub-minute intervals, down to every 10 seconds, and defaults to 30 seconds. There is an adjustable file count limit for externally auto-saved files, that defaults to 20, thereby creating a history of the past 10 minutes when enabled.<br />
By default <em>Auto Save</em> saves externally in a specified folder or in the system's temp dir if none is specified.<br />
Optionally you can set it up to <em>self-safe</em> the currently open file too, which means saving it at the path you have previously chosen, or saving the startup file, if you haven't chosen a path yet.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/save_pie_autosave_prefs.png"><img alt="SavePieAutoSavePreferences" src="img/whatsnew/save_pie_autosave_prefs.png" /></a>
<em>Auto Save settings in the addon preferences, with a custom path set</em></p>
<p>Previously you already could already make MACHIN3tools save automatically before undo- or redo-operations - which are both potential triggers for Blender crashes.<br />
Saving before this happens safeguards against data loss, and both are now sub-features of <em>Auto-Save</em> with <em>Pre-Undo-Saving</em> enabled by default, and <em>Pre-Redo-Saving</em> disabled.<br />
This is how I personally work too.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/save_pie_autosave_tooltip.png"><img alt="SavePieAutoSaveTooltip" src="img/whatsnew/save_pie_autosave_tooltip.png" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking on the <em>Auto Save</em> button in the pie, while holding <code>ALT</code> or <code>CTRL</code> will open the auto save folder in Blender's or the system's filebrowser, so you can quickly access a previously saved file.</p>
<h3 id="smart-face">Smart Face</h3>
<p>Smart Face's object creation (from a face selection) has been updated and supports two new "modes" now. 
Previously it always duplicated the selection, but now it can optionally dissolve the selections boundary edges, or extract the faces, which removes them from the original object.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/smart_face_redo_panel.png"><img alt="SmartFaceRedoPanel" src="img/whatsnew/smart_face_redo_panel.png" /></a>
<em>choose Duplicate, Dissolve or Extract mode, and optionally stay on the original object</em></p>
<p>There's also an option to <em>Stay</em> on the original object now, instead of going into edit mode for the newly created object.</p>
<h3 id="shorts">Shorts</h3>
<p>I've been creating Short videos covering MACHIN3tools, <a href="https://mesh.machin3.io">MESHmachine</a> and <a href="https://decal.machin3.io">DECALmachine</a>, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays accordingly for the past 4 weeks.<br />
Below you can see a compilation of the 4 MACHIN3tools clips in a single video, and in landscape format.</p>
<p>TODO: MACHIN3tools Shorts compilation video.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcEiZ9GDvSdUrcarkE7lwtvFHLZxOfsj5">Tips and Tricks playlist</a> on youtube, to see the others for MESHmachine and DECALmachine too.</p>
<h3 id="more">more</h3>
<p>The Collection pie has been updated and among other things now exposes the viewlayer exclusion toggle (for the first <em>layer collection</em> of a collection in the scene).<br />
The Workspace pie now syncs the active tool when you switch between <em>original</em> and <em>.alt</em> workspace or when forced via <code>ALT</code> mod key.<br />
The Modes pie supports switching into Pose mode, even for Linked Armature objects, when a <em>Library Override</em> is used.<br />
The Shading pie now avoids showing some parts that are not relevant when the render engine is <code>BLENDER_WORKBENCH</code>.  </p>
<p>The Focus tool - when going into <em>Local View</em> now disables <em>Array</em> modifiers, just like it already disabled <em>Mirror</em> modifiers before.</p>
<p>Finally, in Blender 4.5 the new <em>Capture Asset Priview</em> tool is exposed in the Assetbrowser's sidebar panel, directly under the asset's thumbnail for convenience.<br />
With the Assetbrowser tools enabled, both - Blender's new native tool and MACHIN3tool's own thumbnail creation tool - are exposed.</p>
<p>Last but not least, and not a MACHIN3tools but a Blender change - the Note tool is no longer limited by a cap on the size of grease pencil lines, and thereby there is no limit on how small an annotation can be any more in 4.5.</p>
<p>As always, check out the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for a list of all changes and fixes.</p>

<h2 id="112">1.12</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>2025-05-21</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a significant release with major additions to DeusEx too - in particular if you use or intend to use the <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html">Assetbrowser tools</a> and the <a href="group_tools.html">Group tools</a>.  </p>
<p>If you are in a hurry, you can watch this following quick video going over most of the changes and additions.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can also read on and find the specific updates covered below, or head straight to the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>.</p>
<h3 id="paid-update">Paid Update</h3>
<p>This 1.12 update is the first paid update - ending my streak of releasing <a href="changelog.html"><strong>36 free feature updates</strong></a> over the past <strong>7 years</strong> - for MACHIN3tools alone. Updates which have gotten bigger and bigger with each passing year, and this latest one is no exception.<br />
In fact MACHIN3tools has outgrown <a href="https://decal.machin3.io">DECALmachine</a> now and its codebase surpasses it, even the <a href="faq.html#what-is-prime-and-deusex">Prime</a> variant.</p>
<p>It is truly <a href="preferences.html"><strong>a massive addon</strong></a>, and for what it's worth, I've spent over 2 month full-time, 7 days a week - <em>just</em> on this update.  </p>
<p>If you bought MACHIN3tools <strong>less than a year ago</strong>, then this update is <strong>still free</strong> for you and will download automatically. <br />
Otherwise please see the following FAQ entries for details on <a href="faq.html#how-do-paid-updates-work"><em>how paid updates work</em></a>, if you are out of the free update period, as well as more details on <a href="faq.html#why-arent-updates-free"><em>why paid updates are introduced now</em></a>.<br />
It should be very straight forward, I think it's a steal, and I thank you in advance should you choose to continue to support my work üôè</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let's go over the major changes and additions in MACHIN3tools 1.12 now.</p>
<h3 id="asset-browser-tools">Asset Browser Tools</h3>
<p><a href="assetbrowser_tools.html">Assembly Asset Creation</a> now supports <a href="faq.html#what-does-severely-hidden-mean">severely hidden objects</a>, which are objects in excluded or hidden collections.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYtTX31sAT8?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p><a href="assetbrowser_tools.html">Assembly Asset Creation</a> now also supports keeping DECALmachine backups or MESHmachine stashes around.<br />
These will persist after dropping an asset into a new file after disassembly or when editing an assembly.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/FzppR97aF_w?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Also, you can now optionally create <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html">Assembly Assets</a> without duplicating the originally selected objects.<br />
This is a bit more limited - for instance it doesn't support <em>sub-assembly assets</em> - and in my opinion is more suitable to simple assemblies, but it may suit your workflow better.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/nK_SDIIr004?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p><em>Sub-Assembly Assets</em> are ones created from part of a larger hierarchy of objects, which is now supported via the <em>Selection Only</em> toggle in the <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html"><em>Create Assembly Asset</em></a> popup.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4GWeEtpagf8?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p>To avoid repetitive tasks, you can now also add tags and metadata at time of <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html">asset creation</a>.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/P35_otR9RJI?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The <a href="faq.html#what-is-prime-and-deusex">DeusEx variant</a> introduces a Thumbnail Helper Gizmo, that offers precise control over the <em>Asset's Thumbnail framing</em>, which can sometimes be off a bit when done automatically, in particular with rotated mirrored objects present within the assembly. </p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wsIdBAwRXxo?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p><a href="faq.html#what-is-prime-and-deusex">DeusEx</a> also allows you to directly introspect and <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html#edit-assembly"><strong>edit any Assembly</strong></a> or Instance Collection.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vDtIXvRL-M?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html#assembly-origin"><em>Assembly Origin</em></a> is now set <em>relative</em> to the Assembly's empty object, but can optionally still be set relative to the <em>original</em> assembly objects.<br />
In addition you can now <strong>reset</strong> the origin, thereby making the instance collection empty the <em>world origin</em> within the collection.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAac1f0nFUI?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p><a href="faq.html#what-is-prime-and-deusex">DeuxEx</a> also allows you to change an assembly/instance collection origin's rotation/orientation now - something that Blender itself doesn't support directly, as the instance collection offset only affects translation.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1838yIKXu0Q?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Also, instead of adjusting the <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html#assembly-origin"><em>Assembly Origin</em></a> from the sidebar, you can now do it from the <a href="pie_cursor_origin.html"><em>Cursor and Origin</em> pie</a> as well.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQxBYQrLLfw?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p>In <a href="faq.html#what-is-prime-and-deusex">DeusEx</a>, you can now create <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html#assembly-variants"><em>Assembly Variants</em></a> to create unique variations of existing assemblies.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-Tm2saZ-Lk?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Also in <a href="faq.html#what-is-prime-and-deusex">DeusEx</a> - and particularly useful for <em>Assembly Variants</em> or also any user-created Instance Collection - you can now easily turn them into a <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html#turn-assembly-into-asset">local asset with proper thumbnail</a>, and optionally with tags and metadata.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6Dt__q3rCk?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Finally, once you are happy and finished with your assets, you can then use the new <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html#asset-storage"><em>Clean-out Non-Assets</em></a> tool, which creates an efficiently small a blend file that contains only the assets and related data.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8NotSbJWm4?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="group-tools">Group Tools</h3>
<p>Working with <a href="group_tools.html"><em>Groups</em></a> (empty parent hierarchies) has been further improved and MACHIN3tools now allows you to visualize Group relationships, by drawing their hierarchy in the 3D View.<br />
This is done automatically when entering <em>Group Origin Adjustment Mode</em> or <em>Outliner Group Mode</em>.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEgsyw6RK7I?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p><a href="group_tools.html#group_tools-mode"><em>Group Mode</em></a> has been improved and among other things now automatically toggles <em>Group Selection Behavior</em> and <em>Group Empty Visibility</em>.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BE1xl5GwX7I?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p><em>Group auto-naming</em> has been improved significantly, and avoids Blender-added index suffixes at the end of a group empty's name, if group suffixes are enabled in the <a href="preferences.html"><em>addon preferences</em></a> .</p>
<div class='video'> 
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/squCbrrWSng?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The <a href="group_tools.html#select-group_tools"><em>Select Group</em></a> tool now behaves differently in <em>Local View</em>, and now automatically brings Group objects into <em>Local View</em>, while avoiding recursive selection, unless forced via the <code>CTRL</code> mod key.</p>
<div class='video'> 
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrZGuH4kAho?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="select-hierarchy">Select Hierarchy</h3>
<p>The <a href="select.html#select-hierarchy"><em>Select Hierarchy</em></a> tool has been completely rewritten and now supports <a href="faq.html#what-does-severely-hidden-mean"><em>severely hidden objects</em></a>, which are those in excluded or hidden collections.<br />
The HUD and redo panel have been improved and selecting everything in a hierarchy is now quicker than ever.</p>
<div class='video'>
  <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lq8PuXlC-Kk?rel=0' style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder='0' loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="extrude-tools">Extrude Tools</h3>
<p>MACHIN3tools now exposes the Blender-native Extrude menu popup keymap in its <a href="preferences.html">addon preferences</a>.<br />
Neither the <a href="extrude.html#cursor-spin">Cursor Spin</a> nor the <a href="extrude.html#punch-it">Punch It</a> tool (in MACHIN3tools) are key-mapped by default, and instead they are accessed either from the native Extrude menu popup, from the 3D view's sidebar, or now also from the native <code>CTRL + F</code> Face context menu.</p>

<h3 id="modes-pie">Modes Pie</h3>
<p>The <a href="pie_modes.html">Modes Pie</a>'s button at the top in <em>Object Mode</em> can now be changed to be a Sculpt button, simplifying the switch to <em>Sculpt mode</em> and back.<br />
This is optional and legacy behavior can be restored, but it is the new default now, as the <em>Edit mode</em> button is a bit redundant with the direct <em>Mesh Element</em> modes available at the bottom too.</p>

<p>There are also new <a href="installation.html"><em>Installation</em></a>, <a href="faq.html#get-support"><em>Get Support</em></a> and <a href="preferences.html">addon preferences</a> videos, that hopefully address all the various Blender issues that can possibly come up, thereby simplifying and streamlining my support process, or eleminating the need for it altogether.  </p>
<p>The FAQ has been extended and covers more of these issues too, as well as a number of other common questions.</p>
<p>In case it's not obvious yet also I've spent significant time<sup>roughly 1 month</sup> on documenting this update, and updating the various sub-pages of these docs too.<br />
This is an ongoing process, and I expect to make more improvements over the coming weeks, including new narrated videos for older tools and features.</p>

<p>This √≠s the Blender 4.3 release, and with that, I'm also raising the minimum version to 4.2 LTS now.</p>
<div class='video'>

</div>

<h3 id="note-tool-and-grease-pencil-v3">Note tool and Grease Pencil v3</h3>
<p>One of the major changes in Blender 4.3 is the rewrite of GreasePencil - internally now called <strong>v3</strong>.<br />
The <a href="pie_modes.html">Modes</a> and <a href="pie_tools.html">Tools</a> pies have been updated to support the new Grease Pencil type in Blender 4.3, and adapt to the API changes accordingly.<br />
You would think Grease Pencil is not a major part of MACHIN3tools - and you would be right - but addressing all the changes still took over a week..</p>
<p>However, that also includes a new tool, because I took this opportunity to add a Notes tool, which allows you to easily add text 
notes anywhere on your model - useful if you don't work with a tablet, or dislike writing by hand.</p>
<p>Textual notes are not only useful for yourself - as little reminders or ideas with spacial context - but also when working collaboratively of course.</p>
<div class='video'>

</div>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note<p>The tool works a bit differently in Blender 4.2 vs 4.3, as demonstrated in the video above.</p>
<p>In 4.2 it is fully annotation based, and so notes only exist on annotation layers, not as scene objects.<br />
In 4.3, this is no longer possible, and I had to resort to creating Grease Pencil objects, that hold the notes.</p>
</p>
<p><em>benefits</em></p>
<ul>
<li>parented to objects</li>
<li>easily transform notes afterwards</li>
</ul>
<p><em>disadvantages</em></p>
<ul>
<li>clutters scene with GP objects</li>
<li>in SOLID Single shading has solid color, not annotation color; may require multiply blend mode to be legible</li>
<li>has minimum stroke thickness hard cap, limiting use of small notes</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With an active Grease Pencil object in draw mode, the Tools pie now exposes the Brush, Line and Erase tools, as well as quick access to the object's Grease Pencil layers and tint color in other modes.</p>
<p><img alt="ToolsPieGreasePencilDrawTools" src="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_gp_draw.jpg" />
<em>Tools pie in GreasePencil draw mode</em></p>
<p>The ToggleAnnotations tool in Blender 4.3 supports toggling layers of Grease Pencil Note objects in 4.3 too now - in addition to regular annotations, thereby creating a consistent 4.2-like experience, and avoiding having to micro-manage Grease Pencil objects.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_toggle_annotations.jpg"><img alt="ToolsPieToggleAnnotations" src="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_toggle_annotations.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3 id="align">Align</h3>
<p>The <a href="align.html">Align</a> tool got some last minute updates.</p>
<p>You can now align objects based on the local axes of the active object or the cursor.</p>
<div class='video'>

</div>

<p>Furthermore, bone alignment and in-between alignment have been updated and now support setting the relative slide distance.</p>
<h3 id="assetbrowser-tools">AssetBrowser tools</h3>
<p>For assembly assets created with MACHIN3tools, you can now adjust the asset origin afterwards in different ways.  </p>
<p>You can also update thumbnails for other asset types now: objects, collections, materials and  poses<sup>I think even actions</sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, when you hold down the ALT key, you can ensure overlays are rendered too, which may be useful when you want an armature to appear on the thumbnail for instance.</p>
<div class='video'>

</div>

<h3 id="filebrowser-tools">FileBrowser tools</h3>
<p>The modal tool used to adjust thumbnail sizes in the file- and asset browsers - invoked via <code>3</code> by default - has been extended to support the Asset Shelf too now.<br />
As of Blender 4.3, asset shelves are where your brushes for painting, sculpting and grease pencil are accessed from.</p>
<p>Also, in the asset browser, selecting the import method is now also a modal operator, that works similarly as adjusting thumbnail sizes: Hold <code>4</code> and move the mouse horizontally.</p>
<div class='video'>

</div>

<h3 id="save-pie_1">Save Pie</h3>
<p>The Save pie now optionally supports glTF and Better FBX importing and exporting.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/save_pie_import_export.jpg"><img alt="SavePieImportExport" src="img/whatsnew/save_pie_import_export.jpg" /></a>

<p class="admonition-title">Keep in mind</p>
<p><a href="https://blendermarket.com/products/better-fbx-importer--exporter">Better FBX</a> is not included in MACHIN3tools</p>

<p>Also the Load Next/Previous tools ask for confirmation if the currently open file is unsaved, before prodceeding.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/save_pie_next_previous_warning.jpg"><img alt="SavePieLoadNextPreviousWarning" src="img/whatsnew/save_pie_next_previous_warning.jpg" /></a>
<em>Confirm before loading the next/previous file, while the current file is unsaved</em></p>
<h3 id="snapping-pie_1">Snapping Pie</h3>
<p>In the Snapping pie you can now set snap elements additively, by holding the ALT key.<br />
So for instance, you can enable <em>VERTEX</em> and <em>EDGE</em> snapping at the same time.</p>
<p>A fading label is drawn whenever you pick a Snap Preset to indicate what exactly is enabled at the current time.<br />
Snap elements are also shown at the top of the pie now.</p>
<p>Finally, Grid snapping now uses the <em>CLOSEST</em> target, not <em>MEDIAN</em>.</p>

<p>The paint and sculpt modes in the Modes pie have been fleshed out some more, and now also show pie buttons for object and edit mesh modes for quick access.</p>

Enjoy Blender 4.3 and please support my work, if you haven't already...  </p>
<p>All of this documentation is a lot of additional work, and is free.<br />
It eats up a lot of my time and energy, that I'd rather spend developing or making art.  </p>
<p>So I hope you appreciate it, and thank you for reading this far.</p>
<h2 id="1101">1.10.1</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>2024-08-05</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is mostly a bug fix release, but not completely.</p>
<p>The general focus is on linked assets/data, which is now handled much better, and again less invasive than if you were to use Blender's native <code>make_local</code> operator, which requires the <code>type='ALL'</code> arg to make linked instance collections accessible.
That however would make all linked data in the blend file local, which you probably want to avoid.</p>
<p>The MakeLocal tool in MACHIN3tools is more targeted to the selection only, and in addition to object data, handles <em>instance_collection</em> data too.</p>

<h2 id="110">1.10</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>2024-08-01</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the Blender 4.2 update. This took considerably more time than I initially thought it would, hence the delay and being 2 weeks "late". But I hope you agree the delay was worth the wait, and that this is a good one.</p>
<p>The 2 major areas of focus in this release are Eevee Next in Blender 4.2, and the AssetBrowser tools which have been completely reworked, offering a simpler UX and better results.</p>
<div class="video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOSPR2nHWCQ?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="assetbrowser-tools_1">AssetBrowser tools</h3>
<p>Assembly Asset creation is easier than ever. MACHIN3tools will look through an entire parent-child hierarchy and find all relevnt objects in it as well as all mod objects. So your selection for creating the asset can be very simple and doesn't have to encompass all objects.</p>
<p>The asset origin/empty can now by placed in the Cursor's location too.
Furthermore, the thumbnail can now be updated after the asset is created, and this can be done from the 3D view, or the asset browser.</p>
<div class="video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FuxTlIy-R0Y?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Internally, when an asset is created all the original objects are now being duplicated and so left untouched. This allows me to make some decisions so you don't have to.
Duplicated asset objects are then placed in a dedicated asset collection, which itself will be placed in a main <em>_Assets</em> collection. Both will be linked to the scene, but hidden from the viewlayer.</p>
<p>Doing it like this is more transparent and allows you to see what is going on. That said, if you want to make a change to an asset it may still be wise to just remove it and re-create it from the original objects instead.</p>
<p>Asset collection objects are no longer being moved to the world origin now, and instead the <em>instance_offset</em> is used.</p>
<p><a href="vid/whatsnew/remove_assembly_asset.webp"><img alt="RemoveAssemblyAsset" src="vid/whatsnew/remove_assembly_asset.webp" /></a>
<em>Remove Assembly or entire Asset</em></p>
<p>There is a removal tool now, that allows you to remove an assembly asset, and its instance collection in one go, as long as it doesn't have any other users anymore.
For local assets, so those stored in the very file you are creating them in, you can also remove the entire asset and any potential instances in one go. Naturally this will remove the asset from the asset browser.</p>
<p>Thumbnail Rendering has been overhauled completely.
MACHIN3tools will find your asset wherever it is on the 3D view, and frame it perfectly for you.
As before, <em>viewport rendering</em> is used, so you can create thumbnails from SOLID shading, or using Eevee in MATERIAL or RENDERED shading.
Camera views are supported now, so you can even use effects like Depth of Field, if you want.
Furthermore, Cycles is supported as well now, if you chose is as the renderer, in which case <em>still rendering</em> is used automatically.</p>
<div class="video">

</div>

<p>Disassembling an asset, so making the individual asset objects accessible, will now ensure objects and collections are local (not linked), and do so recursively.
If objects in the asset are <em>Rigid Bodies</em>, the necessary setup to make that work again will be performed after disassembly.</p>
<div class="video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3U-vxpfLW04?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The sidebar panels in both the 3D view and the asset browser will now expose the instance collection name of assembly assets.</p>
<p><img alt="AssetCollectionNames" src="img/whatsnew/asset_collection_names.jpg" />
<em>asset collection names in the sidebar panels</em></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Since I can either prepend or append to existing Blender panels, the collection name property precedes the actual asset name.</p>
</div>
<p>The sidebar panel will also list child assets, that are part of a bigger asset of assets, and will do so recursively in a tree-like fashion, should there be multiple levels.</p>
<h4 id="thumbnail-scaling-local-library-bookmark">Thumbnail Scaling + Local Library Bookmark</h4>
<div class="video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8WnKpGsdU5w?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Scaling thumbnails in the AssetBrowser - keymapped to <code>3</code> by default, is now a modal operator, meaning you can interactively scale thubmails by moving the mouse.
This works in the FileBrowser too, and you can disable it in the addon prefs for the FileBrowsser tools, should you prefer the legacy behavior which cycled through different sizes.</p>
<p>The Bookmarks Bar now comes with a new pseudo-bookmark for the local library, called <em>Current File</em>.  It's keymapped to <code>ALT + ^</code> by default.</p>
<p><img alt="LocalPseudoBookmark" src="img/whatsnew/current_file_pseudo_bookmark.jpg" />
<em>the Current File pseudo bookmark at the beginning of the asset bookmarks bar</em></p>
<p>Note, that unlike the regular bookmarks, you can not assign a catalog to it, nor a thumbnail size.
So instead switching to this bookmark will select the most used catalog in the file, and auto-scale the thumbnails based on the asset browser dimensions.
This should ensure that at least something is shown at all, because unfortunately its impossible to select the <em>All</em> catalog via the API.</p>
<h3 id="shading-pie-eevee-next">Shading Pie (Eevee Next)</h3>
<p>Eevee Next is here, brings realtime raytracing, and along with that a completely different way to set things up and tweak it all.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/eevee_next_high_preset.jpg"><img alt="EeveeNextHighPreset" src="img/whatsnew/eevee_next_high_preset.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>As in previous version you can quickly adjust the Eevee settings (which are used in MATERIAL shading too), even when your render engine is set to Cycles.
Also as before you have preset buttons at the top of the Eevee box, that allow you to quickly change multiple settings at once. Refer to the tooltips for details.</p>
<p>New in Blender 4.2 are user-presets, which can be set from the Properties editor in the Raytracing panel. If you set some of these up for yourself, the Shading Pie will find and expose them for you.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/eevee_next_user_presets.jpg"><img alt="EeveeNextHighPreset" src="img/whatsnew/eevee_next_user_presets.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Now, your first reaction to this Eevee Next panel may be being overwhelmed, but I assure you it's easier and more efficient than the alternative.
The only things you will want to adjust in 99% of the cases are 1. the presets and 2. the thickness value, which is why I chose to highlight it in red.</p>
<p>Also, if you look at it with the <em>None</em> preset chosen you will see it's not so bad :)</p>

<p>To make life easier, I have combined 6 settings into 3 "multi-props".
Adjusting Thickness, Resolution, or Precision (Quality) will adjust the natively independent Screen-Trace and Fast GI settings of the same name at the same time.</p>
<p>For example, changing resolution from 1:2 to 1:4, will change both the Screen-Trace resolution and the Fast GI resolution accordingly.</p>
<p>I've also exposed the Shadow and AO passes directly for quick access. Shadow in particular can be very cool to get a very graphic visual read of a scene or design.</p>

<h4 id="bloom">Bloom</h4>
<p>Eevee Next no longer has a Bloom toggle. But the Shading Pie still does!</p>
<div class="video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3x5Fv1kkvA?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>In Blender 4.2, the Bloom toggle of the Shading Pie will set up Bloom via the compositor for you, or toggle it, if it has been set up already. I've thrown in a Dispersion toggle on top of it too.
What's cool is, not only are these effects shown and adjustable in realtime, they also work just the same in Cycles!</p>
<h4 id="volumes">Volumes</h4>
<p>Similarly, there is no Volume toggle in native Blender, but there is on in the Shading Pie!</p>
<p>It does two things, because volumes exist in either of 2 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>a global world volume set up by nodes in your world</li>
<li>volume objects</li>
</ol>
<p>Without volume objects being present, turning on Volume rendering will setup a basic world volume for you, and expose some basic settings in the pie.
With volume objects being present, their visibility will be toggled by adjusting viewport filtering. This way individual object visibility states are never touched and changed.</p>
<p>If you have volume objects present, but in addition you also want to add a world volume, you can do so by <code>SHIFT</code> clicking on the volume toggle.</p>
<div class="video">

</div>

<h4 id="world">World</h4>
<p>More World properties are being exposed now.</p>
<p>Blender 4.2 introduced the ability to toggle world shadows, so shadows dynamically created from HDRIs! Cool.
You can even soften them by increasing the Sun Angle (size).</p>
<div class="video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9TIpPZpBU0?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Also, if you use the scene world, MACHIN3tools will check your world node setup and look for a number of generic property names, such as <em>Rotation</em> or <em>Rotation Z</em>, which - if found - allows you to rotate your world directly from the pie.
Also also, if you use the EasyHDRI addon, then know that its node groups are supported too.</p>
<h3 id="views-pie">Views Pie</h3>
<p>Next, the Views Pie has received some updates.</p>
<div class="video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hDl7UpABSE?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>When using Smart Cam to create a new camera from the view, by default the view will now be perfectly matched, which is achieved by matching the render resolution ratio to the view's ratio.
Also a camera sensor width of 72 is used, while the current viewport's Field of View is brought over to the camera.</p>
<p>When in camera view, you can now easily toggle Depth of Field, and set it up by either adjusting the focus distance directly, by picking an existing focus object, or by creating a new focus empty.
Also, when you come back to an existing DoF setup at a later point, you can easily select the focus object from the pie, even it it's hidden or not in local view.</p>
<p>A fading HUD has been added to the SmartCam and Next/Prev Cam tools too, for additional <s>hotness</s> user feedback.</p>
<h3 id="save-pie_2">Save Pie</h3>
<p>For the Save Pie's export options, you can now define root export folders per-file type in the addon preferences.</p>
<p><img alt="SavePieExportFolders" src="img/whatsnew/save_pie_export_folders.jpg" /></p>
<p>Beyond that, Purging and Cleaning out the file have both been improved. In 4.2 you can now get a Purge Preview by invoking the tool with the <code>SHIFT</code> mod key.
Purging will also remove empty collections now, which Blender's native tool doesn't do, unless they are also unlinked.</p>
<h3 id="tools-pie">Tools Pie</h3>
<p>Due to popular demand, I have brought back the BoxCutter and Hardops integrations, as well as the Surface Draw tool (previously in the Modes pie).</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_everything.jpg"><img alt="ToolsPieEverything" src="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_everything.jpg" /></a>
<em>The Tools pie with everything enabled</em></p>
<p>There have been improvements for annotations too.
Surface placement can now be set via buttons instead of a list, and there is a new tool to toggle annotation visibility across all layers.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_annotate.jpg"><img alt="ToolsPieAnnotate" src="img/whatsnew/tools_pie_annotate.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This visibility toggle will take into account manually hidden annotation layers, and will only re-enable those, that have been previously visible too.</p>
<h3 id="blender-42-pie-menu-conflicts">Blender 4.2 Pie Menu Conflicts</h3>
<p>Blender 4.2 sculptors using the Shading and/or Views pies may encounter a keymap conflict due to new native Page Up/Down keymaps for visibility filtering in Sculpt mode.</p>
<p><a href="img/whatsnew/pie_menu_conflicts.jpg"><img alt="42PieMenuConflicts" src="img/whatsnew/pie_menu_conflicts.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>If such a conflict is detected, MACHIN3tools will let you know about it and expose the keymap items, so you can remap them.</p>
<h3 id="more_3">more</h3>
<p>The Material Picker now supports multiple open 3D views and AssetBrowsers<sup>which is just this simple note here, but took me an entire fucking weekend</sup></p>
<p>Also, the Group tool will now indicate and highlight ungroupable objects among the selection, which are those that already are parented so something other than a group empty.
The Outliner in <em>Group mode</em> will now truly only show group empties, <strong>if</strong> you make use of group auto-naming with prefix and/or suffix.</p>
<p>Smart Edge can now connect non-manifold vert selections, creating non-manifold edges.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Modes Pie has added <a href="https://www.1p2d.com/edit-guide-mesh-and-final-mesh-simultaneously">Guide mesh &lt; &gt; Final Mesh Editor</a> support, for convenient <em>Dual Mesh Edit</em> mode toggling.</p>
<p>As always, for a complete list of all changes, check out the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>.<sup>biggest one yet I think</sup></p>
<p>Thanks for your patience and support. Enjoy Blender 4.2. It seems like an amazing release.</p>

<h3 id="material-picker_1">Material Picker</h3>
<p>This update brings QOL<sup>Quality of Life</sup> improvements to the Material Picker tool, that makes it a game changer IMO.
At the core of this is the new <code>RIGHTMOUSE</code> keymap for it.</p>
<p>Since this likely conflicts with many users' keymap for the context menu, I leave <code>RIGHTMOUSE</code> disabled by default, but I recommend you enable it to try it. There is more info below on how you can make it work for you.</p>
<p>You can enable it in two ways:</p>
<p><img alt="ActivateMaterialPickerRMBKeymap1" src="img/material_picker/activate_rmb_keymap1.png" />
<em>1. in the General tab of the MACHIN3tools addon preferences</em></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you leave it disabled, you can chose to add the Material Picker to the top of the context menu instead!
<img alt="MaterialPickerTopLevelContextMenu" src="img/material_picker/top_lvl_context_menu.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><img alt="ActivateMaterialPickerRMBKeymap2" src="img/material_picker/activate_rmb_keymap2.png" />
<em>2. in the Keymaps tab of the MACHIN3tools addon preferences</em></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Keep in mind</p>
<p>The tool is built in a way to work with <code>RIGHTMOUSE</code> as the keymap to invoke<sup>RMB press</sup> and finish<sup>RMB release</sup> the tool.
So mapping it to something other than <code>RIGHTMOUSE</code> is not recommended at this point.
You are free to add a modifier key however, if you want to keep <code>RIGHTMOUSE</code> exclusively for your context menu.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="material-picker-context">Material Picker Context</h4>
<p>Note, that even when enabled, <code>RIGHTMOUSE</code> will only ever invoke the Material Picker, if you are in a shading mode, that displays materials, such as MATERIAL or RENDERED shading.
It can also invoke in SOLID shading, but only if your have MATERIAL chosen as the <em>color_type</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you don't have a Shader Editor or Asset Browser in the current workspace, while also not having any object or face selection, then Material Picker will also not invoke.</p>
<p>In these cases <code>RIGHTMOUSE</code> will be passed through to Blender and do what it would otherwise do, like open the context menu, if that is in your keymap.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-material-picker-actually-do">What does Material Picker actually do?</h4>
<p>Three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It picks a material for you to work on in the Shader Editor directly from the 3D view, without you having to select an object and finding the correct material from the object's material stack.</li>
<li>It assigns a material to any object or face selection, by picking it from another object in the 3D view.</li>
<li>It assigns a material from the asset browser to multiple objects through individual sequential picks, or all at once.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how that works:</p>

<h3 id="asset-browser-tools_1">Asset Browser tools</h3>
<p>With the Filebrowser tools active, you can now cycle the <code>display_type</code> in the Assetbrowser as well via the <code>2</code> key, again just like in the Filebrowser.
You can also cycle the <code>display_type</code> using a dedicated button in the Assetbrowser header, which is most suitable for horizontal layouts however.</p>
<p>Changing the <code>display_type</code> is recognized and rembered by the <a href="toggle_region.html">ToggleRegion</a> tool, as well as by the <a href="#asset-browser-bookmarks">Assetbrowser bookmarks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pricing-and-machin3tools-prime">Pricing and MACHIN3tools Prime</h3>
<p>With this recent batch of addon updates for Blender 4.1, I've decided to bump the price across most of them a little, and MACHIN3tools is no exception.
The <em>Standard</em> variation - previously free on gumroad and github, and sold for $1 on Blender Market, is now history.</p>
<p><strong><em>Prime</em></strong> is now the new base version of MACHIN3tools, and contains ~95% of the feature set compared to DeusEx.
On gumroad - where payment was voluntary - unfortunately less than 1% chose to donate or buy DeusEx, and after 6 years, that has simply proven unsustainable.
Most people don't realize this, but MACHIN3tools is actually my biggest addon in terms of code base, just after DECALmachine, but before MESHmachine. And so it needs to start carrying its own weight now.</p>
<p>I think the new MACHIN3tools pricing - $5 for Prime, $15 for DeusEx - is more than fair and reasonable in the current market environment and with the value that is offered.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Gumroad Donators</p>
<p>If you have gotten MACHIN3tools Standard on gumroad and have donated $5 or more, you have been bumped to DeusEx already.
If you have donated $3.50 or more, then you have been bumped to Prime.</p>
</div>
<p>These pricing changes aim to counter a general downtrend in revenue, in face of rising living and so development costs, that I have observed for over a year now.
The reasons for this are not clear, but it's likely a mix of multiple:</p>
<ul>
<li>post-COVID era</li>
<li>reaching market saturation?</li>
<li>increased competition</li>
<li>lack of new products and social media activity - while my main focus remains on getting HyperCursor out</li>
<li>gen AI and waning interest in Blender?</li>
<li>inflation</li>
<li>layoffs</li>
<li>the one we don't talk about</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, I still want to avoid charging for updates, but it may be inevitable. I'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>If you found MACHIN3tools <em>Standard</em> useful in the past, I would appreciate it if you would consider upgrading to <strong>Prime</strong> or even <strong>DeusEx</strong> now.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support, now on to the 1.8 update...</p>
<h3 id="auto-smooth">Auto Smooth</h3>
<p>This release brings Blender 4.1 support, which introduced changes to <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.1/modeling/">(Auto)Smooth behavior</a>.
I think this change is very welcome, as it gets rid of some odd legacy Blender behavior.</p>
<p>The Shading Pie and its Smooth, Flat and AutoSmooth tools are most affected by this, but I'm happy to say that its look and UX are unchanged compared to previous versions.</p>
<p><img alt="AutoSmooth" src="img/pie_shading/autosmooth.jpg" />
<em>Autosmooth in 4.1 looks behaves identical to how it looks in previous Blender versions</em></p>
<p>Under the hood, instead of toggling the <code>mesh.use_auto_snmooth</code> property, MACHIN3tools will add or remove the new geo node <em>Smooth by Angle</em> modifier to enable or disable Auto Smooth.
MACHIN3tools will automatically add/remove the mod on unselected-but-instanced objects too.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Note that the Auto Smooth mod should be kept at or towards the the end of the stack.
When MACHIN3tools adds the mod, it will be added at the end, but before any Mirror or Array mods, that may be at the end already.
So far this seems like a good general solution. Inevitably we'll probably see use cases, where we may have to manually adjust its position though.</p>
</div>
<p>Personally I like, that you no longer even need to use Auto Smooth for sharp edges to be considered, and neither when using custom normals. Both just work, as you would expect on any smooth shaded mesh object.
Beyond that I like, that we can auto-smooth CURVE objects now, and that it plays well with boolean mods on objects with custom normals, which previously would have their shading messed up.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Keep in mind</p>
<p>Addons like HardOps, BoxCutter or HyperCursor<sup>in pre-release on <a href="http://www.patreon.com/machin3">Patreon</a></sup>, tend do do their own modifier sorting, which can be very useful and avoids having to micro-manage modifier stack order.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="asset-browser-bookmarks">Asset Browser Bookmarks</h3>
<p>If you appreciate the Asset Browser, you will love Asset Browser Bookmarks.</p>
<p><img alt="AssstBrowserBookmarks" src="img/assetbrowser_tools/assetbrowser_bookmarks.jpg" />
<em>Bookmarks bar in Asset Browser header, and Library - Catalog shown next to it</em></p>
<p>You can jump to any saved bookmark by clicking on it or by using the <code>ALT + 1</code> to <code>√ÄLT + 0</code> keymaps.
You can save any Library + Catalog combination by <code>SHIFT</code> clicking on a number/bookmark. Thumbnail size is saved too by the way.
You can clear a bookmark by <code>CTRL</code> clicking on it.</p>
<p>This is so convenient to use, and gets even better in combination with the <a href="#16">Toggle Region tool</a>, which can pop up an asset browser area at the top and bottom of your 3d view at any time.</p>
<p>The bookmarks bar is of course of less use in a vertical setup:
<img alt="AssstBrowserBookmarksVectical" src="img/assetbrowser_tools/vertical_bookmarks.jpg" /></p>
<p>However, the shortcuts to recall a bookmark still work without issue.
So if you prefer to work like that, you will just have to temporarily widen the asset browser area, and save your bookmarks while you can see it, then shrink it down again.</p>
<h3 id="integrated-updater">Integrated Updater</h3>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Keep in mind</p>
<p>Since this feature is only introduced now in 1.8, it will only be of use for upcoming releases, so can't be used to install this very 1.8 update yet.</p>
</div>
<p>I've added a custom updater to the addon preferences.
It should be very straight forward to use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unfold it from the top of the MACHIN3tools preferences.</li>
<li>Select the MACHIN3tools zip file to install, if it's in your home dir or Downloads folder, it will be found automatically.</li>
<li>Verify it's the version you want, and Quit Blender to install the update, otherwise remove it.</li>
</ol>
<div class="video">

<em>3 steps to update: unfold, pick update .zip, quit Blender</em></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Installing in this way, has the same benefit as doing a manual update installation in the filebrowser, but without having to do anything in the filebrowser, and without knowing where Blender installs addons.
Updating this way ensures you will not loose any settings, you've have made in a previous version, or any custom keymaps you have set.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="more_5">more</h3>
<p>Please see the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for a complete list of all changes in MACHIN3tools 1.8.</p>

<h2 id="17">1.7</h2>
<h3 id="deusex">DeusEx ‚ù§</h3>
<p>The highlight of this release in terms of new features are definitely the advancements of the <a href="group_tools.html">empty based grouping</a> feature, and in particular Group <em>poses</em> for MACHIN3tools DeusEx.</p>
<p>The TransformGroup tool has been overhauled, it's HUD has been fleshed out, and the UX has been optimized, and also supports previewing and recalling the poses of the active group empty.</p>
<p><img alt="TransformGroup" src="img/group/transform_group.jpg" />
<em>fully fleshed out HUD, with the second pose being previewed</em></p>
<p><em>Poses</em> are simply stored group empty transformations. The focus here, and for now, is only the rotation component<sup>Translation may come in future</sup>.</p>
<p>Scrolling the mouse wheel while the TransformGroup tool is active, allows for easy pose selection and preview, while recalling a selected pose is done simply by releasing the left mouse button.
if you want to skip recalling a pose, while having one previewed - perhaps to compare to the current rotation to it - you can finish the tool with the <code>Space</code> key.</p>
<p>There is also a new tool dedicated to setting up group gizmos directly from the 3D view, instead of doing it from the sidebar.
It conveniently supports view-based axis toggling using the <code>TAB</code> key, so you don't even have to know which rotational axis (in terms of local X,Y or Z) you want to have a gizmo for.
Just align your view and press <code>TAB</code> to toggle the most aligned of the 3 axes.</p>
<div class="video">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmBYj2kRyMo?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>All a group empty's poses, are also shown in the sidebar panel. Here they can be renamed, sorted, recalled, and removed.</p>
<p><a href="img/group/sidebar_poses.jpg"><img alt="SidebarPoses" src="img/group/sidebar_poses.jpg" /></a>
<em>the updated sidebar panel with pose information, even while gizmos are hidden</em></p>
<p>New in 1.7 is also the idea of <strong>BatchPoses</strong>. They are simply individual poses across different group empties in the same group hierarchy, that are related to eachother. They share a unique name in are indicated using the üîó icon.
You can create them using the <em>SetBatchPose</em> tool, which will create a pose of the current group empty rotations for the currently active empty, and all empties below it in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Single- and BatchPoses can be renamed by double clicking on them in the pose list.
Recalling a BatchPose will recall each individual pose of the batch. By default only going down the hierarchy from the active group empty, but optionally also going up.
Individual poses can also be temporarily unlinked from the rest of the batch.</p>

<p>I think this is all very exciting stuff, and I'm looking forward to hear your feedback!</p>
<h3 id="addon-conflicts-blender-crashes">Addon Conflicts + Blender Crashes</h3>
<p>Over the past months a few users and developers reported conflicts with other addons.
These would present themselves as slow performance, such as when rotating a group, or even Blender crashes.
In particular ZenUV and ZenSets, as well as GridModeller, Archipack and NodeTreeStore were affected.</p>
<p>These issues should now be resolved, by delaying execution of handler logic to a later, safer state.
Thanks to Alex<sup>ZenUV</sup> and Stephen<sup>Archipack</sup> for your help and suggestions, and thanks to kushiro<sup>GridModeller</sup> for his patience with this too :)</p>
<h3 id="select-hierarchy_1">Select Hierarchy</h3>
<p><a href="select.html#select-hierarchy">Select Hierarchy</a> now supports selecting a parent-child hierarchy <em>up</em> as well.
I've added a fading HUD, which is used to indicate if the top or bottom of a hierarchy is reached, and optionally if there are hidden parents or children left.</p>
<p><img alt="SelectHierarchy1" src="img/selection/select_hierarchy1.gif" />
<em>Selecting up and down the hierarchy until the top and bottom of the hierarchy is reached</em></p>
<p>This tool aims to fully replace Blender's native Select Parent/Child tools, and comes with additional features, such as the ability to unhide children and parents, including recursively.</p>
<p><img alt="SelectHierarchy1" src="img/selection/select_hierarchy2.gif" />
<em>Seleciing down, then up, then reaching top with hidden parent, selecting further up with unhide feature, and finally recursively selecting down and unhiding</em></p>
<h3 id="toggle-region">Toggle Region</h3>
<p><a href="toggle_region.html">Toggle Region</a> now works in all node editors and in the Image/UV editor, to toggle either the tool bar or the side bar with a single <code>T</code> key.</p>

<p>The BevelShader toggle has been improved and will in Blender 4 also connect to the <em>Coat Normal</em> inputs.
Furthermore it now works for DECALmachien panel decals as well.
Conveniently, adjusting the bevel with on the panel decal's parent object, will automatically set it for the panel decal as well.</p>

<!-- > 2023-11-10 -->

<p>This is the <strong>Blender 4.0</strong> compatibility release.</p>
<h3 id="toggle-region_1">Toggle Region</h3>
<p>Besides a number of tweaks and fixes, MACHIN3tools 1.6 adds the new <a href="toggle_region.html">Toggle Region</a> tool.
It - via a single T keymap - allows you to toggle the Toolbar, Sidebar and 2 Asset Browsers (or one Asset Shelf and one Asset Browser) per-3D view.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The new asset shelf in Blender 4.0, is not very useful yet, and so toggling that is disabled by default.
It can can be used in combination with the Pose Library addon apparently though, but not so much for bringing in external assets.</p>
</div>
<p>More interesting than the shelf however, is the ability to toggle a new <strong>asset browser area</strong> at the top or bottom of the 3D view.
Almost all the tweaks to the layout of the asset browser you can make, are then remembered when closing the asset browser, and restored when opening it again.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for the full list of changes.</p>
<h2 id="13">1.3</h2>
<p>This release brings a nunmber of quality of life improvements, some fixes, and continued HyperCursor integration. HyperCursor is in <a href="https://www.patreon.com/machin3">pre-release on Patreon</a> since Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>See the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for details.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<h2 id="12">1.2</h2>
<p>Version 1.2 mostly fixes some issues, but it also add the SelectHierarchy tool, expands on the previously revamped object axes drawing with the Shading Pie, and extends the object import/export options of the Save Pie.</p>
<h3 id="select-hierarchy_2">Select Hierarchy</h3>
<p><a href="select.html#select-hierarchy">Select Hierarchy</a> is a simple tool to effectively select the children of any object in the selection.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="save-pie-importexport">Save Pie - import/export</h3>
<p>You can now import/export <code>.usd</code> files from the Save Pie, in addition to <code>.obj</code> and <code>.fbx</code>.
All three object types can now also be toggle from the <a href="preferences.html">addon preferences</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>.obj</code> import/export now also supports the new experimental importer/exporter, once you disable the <em>Wavefront OBJ format</em> addon.</p>
<p><img alt="SavePieUSDImport" src="img/pie_save/pie_save.png" />
<em>.usd files can now be imported/exported and all 3 formats can be toggled in the addon prefs</em></p>
<h3 id="shading-pie-draw-object-axes">Shading Pie - draw object axes</h3>
<p>The object axes for the active or any object with the <em>Axes</em> toggle set, can now be drawn in screen space, thereby enforcing a fixed size independent on an object's location in 3d space.</p>
<p><img alt="ShadingPieObjectAxes" src="img/pie_shading/object_axes.png" />
<em>axes drawn in screen space will always appear at the same size</em></p>
<p>With <em>Cycles</em> as the renderer and the viewport in <em>Render</em> mode, you can now also enabled <em>Denoising</em> from the Shading Pie.</p>
<h3 id="more_7">more</h3>
<p>Checkout the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for a list of all the additions, changes and fixes in 1.2.</p>
<h2 id="11">1.1</h2>
<p>This update brings a number of improvements across the board.</p>
<p>The biggest change is easily the introduction of a modal frontend for the <a href="mirror.html">Mirror</a> tool, which enables <em>flick mirroring</em> akin to <em>flick symmetrize</em> in <a href="https://machin3.io/MESHmachine/docs/symmetrize">MESHmachine</a>.</p>
<div class="video">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/041RNIjByV0?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Another useful change is the ability to easily <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html">create assets</a>, without them being located in the world origin. The empty for the collection instance, is now automatically positioned at the averaged location of the selected objects, and offset to the floor.
Alternatively you can position it just averaged, or at the world origin (previous behavior).</p>
<p><img alt="CreateAssemblyAssetPanel" src="img/assetbrowser_tools/create_assembly_asset_panel.png" /></p>
<p><strong>DeusEx users</strong> should know, that the Group Transform tool now supports auto-keying, which can be initiated using the <code>K</code> key.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there's support for the new Hair/Curve sculpting from the <a href="pie_modes.html">Modes Pie</a>, and the object axes display from the <a href="pie_shading.html">Shading Pie</a> has been completely reworked, making it much more usable.</p>
<p>Oh, the <a href="img/pie_workspace/customize.png">Workspace Pie</a> can now be completely customized from the addon prefs.</p>
<p><img alt="WorkSpacePieCustomization" src="img/pie_workspace/customize.png" /></p>
<p>For details on all changes, please see the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="102">1.0.2</h2>
<p>The tiniest of bugfix releases.
It just avoids light visibility/renderability synching, if the render tools aren't actually enabled.
And it fixes a few typos brought to my attention by an awesome Chinese translator.</p>
<h2 id="101">1.0.1</h2>
<p>A small, quick bugfix release.
It turned out the <a href="align.html#align-relative">AlignRelative tool</a> in the standard version was out of sync (and not recent) with the DeusEx version. That is fixed now.</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="assetbrowser_tools.html">CreateAssemblyAsset tool</a> had some issues on Windows, where the generated thumbnail could potentially not be saved.
The thumbnail is now (temporarily) stored in the addon folder, and assigned to the asset automatically.</p>
<h2 id="10">1.0</h2>
<h3 id="6-years-in-the-making">6 years in the making</h3>
<p>Work on MACHIN3tools has been going on fairly continuously for almost 6 years now. And what a time it has been.</p>
<p>I've switched to Blender 2.77 (from Modo) in spring 2016, when I saw amazing things happening in its addon ecosytem. I was blown away by HardOps, RetopoFlow and Wazou's pie menus in particular.
And I have never looked back since.
I had started learning Python at the very beginning of 2016. Around summer, I started exploring Blender's API, which lead to a loose collection of various separate scripts.
Towards the end of the year I've put them on github. under the name <em>MACHIN3tools</em> following the tradition of Looptools, Edgetools and MiraTools.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2018, When Blender 2.80 became increasingly usable, ~6 months before its release, I had a good reason and opportunity to bring them all together in a single, modular, customizable package which was the 0.3 release.</p>
<p><strong>28 releases later and we are here now - 1.0</strong></p>
<p>My thanks go out to everyone who has come along for the ride, everyone who has offered feedback, encouragement and support. Thank you so much!
And my deepest gratitude goes to those, who have inspired me, artistically and technically.</p>
<p>Blender is in great shape with the recent 3.1 release, and I feel so is MACHIN3tools 1.0. I'm happy what it has become, and I hope you will find it as useful as I do.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>Version 1.0 is now fully documented - well kind of. It's not on the level of the <a href="https://machin3.io/DECALmachine/docs">DECALmachine</a> and <a href="https://machin3.io/MESHmachine/docs">MESHmachine</a> docs, due to MACHIN3tools being mostly free, but the Deus Ex version and recently <a href="https://patreon.com/machin3">Patreon</a><sup>Thanks Guys and Girls!</sup> has allowed me to finally spend a few weeks on documenting.</p>
<p>Every tool and every pie menu, that you can <a href="preferences.html">activate in the addon preferences</a>, has its own entry in the navbar to the left, and I'd invite you to explore this.
If you have specific questions about anything in the docs, that you feel is unclear or lacking, feel free to ask for more information and I'll try to expand on it.</p>
<h3 id="groups">Groups</h3>
<p><a href="group_tools.html">Groups</a> were added in the beginning of 2021 and have quickly become one of my favourite features of MACHIN3tools. I use them for everything now.
So it's about time they are documented too.</p>

<h3 id="render">Render</h3>
<p>In preparation for this release, and as a content source, I have allowed myself to do some personal design work again, which resulted in a few <a href="render.html">Render tools</a>. These tools are a direct, albeit delayed response to friction in my rendering workflow, that I encountered with the <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/KK9gB">Humanoid Mecha</a>.</p>

<h3 id="punch-it">Punch It</h3>
<p><a href="extrude.html">Punch It</a> is finally here in Deus Ex. Although a simple version is also available in the Standard version.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This video is taken from the <a href="https://machin3.io/PUNCHit/docs#punchit">PUNCHit documentation</a>
The tool in MACHIN3tools behaves exactly the same, however it's only accessible from the Extrude Menu, and there is no shortcut set for it.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for more additions and changes.</p>
<h2 id="010">0.10</h2>
<p>This is an unplanned release, adding only the <em>Assemble Collection</em> tool, which is accessed from the <em>Modes Pie</em>, while a <em>Collection Instance</em> is selected.</p>
<p>This is especially useful for <strong>Collection Instance Assets</strong>, which is currently the only way to use the Asset Browser with <em>Object Assemblies</em>.</p>
<div class="video">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdcR3Jqe0bg?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>
<p><em>box bot design inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/ArtFromRachel">Rachel Frick</a></em></p>
<p>This supports linked and appended collection instance assets. It supports empty hierarchies and so MACHIN3tools' groups.
And it also supports DECALmachine's <a href="https://machin3.io/DECALmachine/docs/get_backup/index.html">Decal backups</a> and MESHmachine's <a href="https://machin3.io/MESHmachine/docs/create_stash/">Stashes</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, I also have a <a href="https://patreon.com/machin3">Patreon</a> account now, where I will do pre-releases of upcoming addons, and <a href="https://twitter.com/machin3io/status/1499788313468801029">where I share blend files</a>, if I manage to find time for art. So if you are interested in further supporting my work, that would be a good way to do it. It is very much appreciated! Thank you for considering!</p>
<h2 id="09">0.9</h2>
<p>This release touches on a number of areas, so there should be something for everybody here.</p>
<h3 id="screencast">ScreenCast</h3>
<p>The biggest addition is clearly the <em>ScreenCast</em> tool - accessed from the Save Pie.
It is - like most things I do - primarily driven by my own needs, but I think others will also appreciate it.</p>
<p>The focus of this tool is not on screen casting the keys a user presses, but the tools that are actually run - whether they are called via shortcut or from a menu.
This includes a history of the last 12 (adjustable) operators.</p>
<p>I find this is much more important - and I imagine it's much more useful to new users - when watching somebody else working.
Custom shortcuts are huge in 3D apps, and people shouldn't obsess about what key was pressed at a specific time.</p>
<p><img alt="ScreenCast" src="img/whatsnew/screencast.jpg" />
<em>ScreenCast tool at the bottom left, Screencast Keys addon (custom fork) at the bottom right</em></p>
<p>That said, if you have the <a href="https://github.com/nutti/Screencast-Keys">Screencast Keys addon</a> enabled, the MACHIN3tools ScreenCast tool will enable it, so both can run in parallel.
Note, that they won't always be in sync. Not every tool will be called via a shortcut, and not every key press will call a tool.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Keep in mind</p>
<p>While the <em>Screencast Keys addon</em> can catch key presses in modal operators, if that is enabled in its preferences, it won't catch key presses in menus.
For instance, toggling the Grid in MACHIN3tools' Shading Pie via <code>PageUp + G</code> will only show up as <code>PageUp</code>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="save-pie_3">Save Pie</h3>
<p>In addition to the <em>ScreenCast</em> tool, there's another addition to the Save Pie: The <em>ReloadLinkedLibraries</em> tool.</p>
<p><img alt="ReloadLinkedLibraries" src="img/whatsnew/reload_linked_libraries.jpg" />
* Thanks to <a href="https://www.artstation.com/tituslvr">TitusLVR</a> for this contribution!*</p>
<h3 id="snapping-pie_2">Snapping Pie</h3>
<p>The Snapping Pie now comes in 2 layouts, with the new one having the option for <em>Absolute Grid Snapping</em>.
You can switch between the two directly from the pie itself, or from the addon preferences.</p>
<p><img alt="SnappingPieLayouts" src="img/whatsnew/snapping_pie_layouts.jpg" />
<em>the two layouts - one with grid snapping - can be toggled using the button at the top right</em></p>
<h3 id="collection-pie">Collection Pie</h3>
<p>You can now add and move objects to collections, while in local/focus mode. Yep.</p>
<h3 id="smart-vert_1">Smart Vert</h3>
<p>Smart Vert now supports CENTER merging (<code>SHIFT + 1</code>) edge and face selections. Edges will be merged per sequence (connected edges), and faces per island (connected faces).</p>
<p>Similarly Smart Vert now also supports LAST merging (<code>1</code>) edge(sequences) and face(islands) selections. Note however that edge and face selections won't have a LAST(active) vertice. Instead the mouse is used to roughly point at the vert you want to merge to.</p>
<p>In SlideExtend mode (<code>SHIFT + ALT + 1</code>) you can now enable the <em>Flatten</em> option using the <code>F</code> key. This means you can skip using MESHmachine's <a href="https://machin3.io/MESHmachine/docs/flatten">Flatten</a> tool right after, if you want to create a planar face at the end.</p>
<div class="video">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dp4rxHzBows?rel=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen seamless frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>SlideExtend snapping has been updated to use a more generalized approach, initially developed for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h_wlwp4WG0">HyperCursor</a>(unreleased). The UX remains unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="smart-edge">Smart Edge</h3>
<p>With this version SmartEdge not only supports selection conversion (<code>2</code>) to Bounds/Region as it used to do, but also selecting Adjacent Edges or Faces.
As with Bounds/Region, the initial selection type determines the result. An Edge Selection will be turned into a Face Selection, and a Face Selection will be turned into an Edge Selection.<sup>The latter is also possible natively by <code>CTRL</code> switching to Face mode!</sup></p>
<div class="video">

</div>

<p>In previous versions you could use SmartEdge via <code>SHIFt + 2</code> to toggle edge selections <em>Sharp</em>.
Now you can alternatively also create bevel-mod-based <em>Chamfers</em> and <em>Korean Bevels</em>, using the same shortcut.</p>
<div class="video">

</div>

<h3 id="filebrowser-tools_1">Filebrowser tools</h3>
<p>There's a new filebrowser tool mapped to <code>3</code> to cycle through thumbnail sizes.
<em>Toggle Hidden Files</em> has been remapped to <code>4</code> accordingly.</p>
<p><img alt="FilebrowserTools" src="img/whatsnew/filebrowser.gif" />
<em>Toggle Sorting <code>1</code>, Toggle Display <code>2</code> and Cycle Thumbnails <code>3</code></em></p>
<h3 id="hud-prefs">HUD prefs</h3>
<p>In the addon preferences, you can now adjust the size of text drawn by various tools with <strong>H</strong>ead<strong>U</strong>p<strong>D</strong>isplays, such as <em>Clean Up</em>, <em>Clipping Toggle</em>, <em>Transform Edge Constrained</em>, <em>Focus</em>, <em>Group</em>, <em>Material Picker</em>, <em>Surface Slide</em> and the <em>Tools Pie</em>.</p>
<p>For tools with fading HUDs you can adjust the fade time accordingly.</p>
<p><img alt="HUDpreferences" src="img/whatsnew/HUDprefs.jpg" /></p>
<p>And if you want lines drawn by <em>SmartVert: SlideExtend</em> to be anti-aliased, you need to enable <em>Use Legacy Line Smoothing</em> in the View3D section.</p>
<h3 id="more_9">more</h3>
<p>There's more, and you can check it out in the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="08">0.8</h2>
<h3 id="deus-ex">Deus Ex</h3>
<p>MACHIN3tools has always been about simple tools to supplement, tweak, improve or fix Blender behavior and usability.
<em>Simple</em> in terms of usability, but also implementation.</p>
<p>Despite considerable development time spent on the entire tool and menu set over the years, it has always been free<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and that won't change.</p>
<p>However, version 0.8 introduces the <a href="edge_constrained_transform.html">Edge Constrained Transform</a>. And while this tool is simple to use, it's implementation is far more complex than any other tool in MACHIN3tools. It's more complex than almost all MESHmachine and DECALmachine tools.</p>
<p>It's a tool, that in terms of development effort could have gone into <a href="https://mesh.machin3.io">MESHmachine</a>, but it doesn't really fit into that tool set, and it's too basic in terms of usability.
It could be it's own addon, but that seems inconvenient for me and you.</p>
<p>That's why I feel like it's warranted to introduce a low-priced-but-paid-nonetheless MACHIN3tools version called <em>Deus Ex</em>.
For now, the only difference to the <em>Standard</em> version is the additional Edge Constrained Transform tool.
In future this may change. Since this tool required the implementation of a rotation and scale transformation tool from the ground up, it opens up a number of transform related opportunities in regards to where this could be taken.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

</div>
<h3 id="standard">Standard</h3>
<p>A new addition in 0.8 is the <em>ToggleSmooth</em> tool, which on a key press<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> turns a flat shaded object into a smooth shaded object.
It supports two workflows - Korean Bevel and SubD (if a subd mod is present), works in edit mode and supports multi-object selections in object mode.</p>
<p><img alt="KoreanBevelSmoothing" src="img/whatsnew/korean_smooth.gif" />
* Korean Bevel Smoothing, by default Overlays are toggled as well*</p>
<p><img alt="SubDSmoothing" src="img/whatsnew/subd_smooth.gif" />
* SubD Smoothing of a single mesh, and entire groups, by default Overlays are not changed*</p>
<p>The Cleanup tool, now features a fading HUD, informing you what, if any, geometry has been removed.</p>
<p><img alt="CleanupHUD" src="img/whatsnew/cleanup_hud.gif" /></p>
<p>Finally, SmartVert's SlideExtend feature has been enhanced twofold, which you can see demoed in this <a href="https://twitter.com/machin3io/status/1378410681708388361">tweet</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can now slide/extend from edge mode, in which case the mouse position is used to determine, which vert - so which side of an edge - is extend.</li>
<li>Edge snapping has been supported since version 0.5. Now you can snap to faces as well. Note, that snapping here works for all edit mesh objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for details on all changes.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has supported MACHIN3tools in the past, may it be through comments, suggestions, recommendations, ratings or donations. I appreciate it, and hope you can consider supporting the Deus Ex version too.</p>
