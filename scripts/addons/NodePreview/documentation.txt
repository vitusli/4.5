NodePreview Documentation
-------------------------

This addon displays rendered thumbnails above Cycles and Eevee shader nodes.

https://blendermarket.com/products/node-preview

# Features

* For each node, a preview thumbnail is rendered
* On edits, all affected nodes are automatically updated
* Previews are rendered in a background process to keep the Blender interface fluid and responsive
* No changes are made to the .blend, others without the addon can still open your scenes without problems
* High-resolution displays supported (works with Blender's resolution scale feature)

# Caveats

* To show previews for packed images, the .blend file has to be saved to disk first, because they are loaded through linking from the .blend file
* Thumbnails of image sequences are not updated when changing frames
* IES nodes are currently not supported

# Installation

https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/preferences/addons.html#rd-party-add-ons
(Open user preferences, choose "install from file", select the downloaded .zip archive, click open, enable the addon in the list)

# Usage

Settings can be found in the user preferences by searching for "Node Preview" and clicking the arrow to the left of the addon entry

# About Me

I am the author of the Blender addon for LuxCore, https://github.com/luxcorerender/blendluxcore
In 2014, I started working on Blender addons by contributing to the LuxRender addon.
NodePreview is my second commercial addon after ImageNodePreview: https://blendermarket.com/products/image-node-preview

# Changelog

v1.21
* Fixed a very rare race condition causing Blender to freeze when disabling the addon or closing Blender
* Use fallback shader for drawing the thumbnails in case shader compilation fails


v1.20
* Fixed text rendering being broken in Blender versions older that 4.0
* Fixed previews no longer updating after saving the .blend file under a new name in Blender 4.2

v1.19
* Fixed previews not working in Blender 4.1.1 when the node tree contained a linked image

v1.18
* Added an option in the user preferences to disable preview updates during animation playback
* Fixed image textures not loading when their name contains more than 57 characters
* Fixed previews not working in Blender 4.2 alpha

v1.17
* Hotfix for an issue with node groups. The Blender API for creating node group sockets was changed and now only
  allows 4 types of sockets to be created (vector, shader, float, color). All other socket types were leading to errors.

v1.16
* Added support for Float and Vector curve nodes
* Improved performance for node groups with lots of links between their nodes
* Improved image texture loading performance in the background process (e.g. from 3s to 0.6s loading time for a giant 40 megapixel image)
* Improved render result loading performance in the background process
* Added support for Raw and Non-Color colorspaces of image textures
* Fixed addon not working if another addon registers a buggy class
* Removed the "nodepreview_worker" binary module (replaced with Blender API and numpy). This makes the addon
  more future-proof, because a new Python version in Blender will no longer require a re-compilation of the binary module.
  The best thing however is that you no longer need to follow special steps when updating or removing the addon.
* Fixed a text rendering problem in Blender 4.0 beta caused by a change in the Blender API
* Fixed problems with node groups in Blender 4.0 beta caused by changes in the Blender API

v1.15
* Added support for UDIM images
* Added a new sphere preview mode. The default shortcut to switch between plane and sphere modes is Ctrl+P
* Eevee is now used to render the previews if Eevee is the active render engine.
  This means that Eevee-only nodes like "Shader to RGB" or "Specular BSDF" are now supported.
* Added a popover menu for Node Preview in the node editor header (button on the right)
* The addon now uses the new GPU module instead of the deprecated BGL module. This makes it more future-proof
  (as BGL will be removed at some point) and also solves a problem that happened on macOS with the new Metal backend.
* Fixed addon not loading in Blender 3.6 alpha due to a change in the Blender API (script_directories)

v1.14
* Fixed a bug causing previews to disappear ("error setting NodePreviewTreeProps.update_first_part")
  (this was a regression introduced in v1.11)

v1.13:
* Fixed a minor bug where an operator poll function would raise an Exception instead of simply returning False
* Fixed background process sometimes not starting on macOS

v1.12:
* Fixed errors happening when nodes had attributes registered by other addons
  (this was a regression introduced in v1.11)
* Fixed previews not updating occasionally when more than one node tree is opened
  (this was a regression introduced in v1.11)
* Fixed incorrect output socket being used on node group instances that have multiple outputs with the same name

v1.11:
* Prevented potential problems when a node name inside a node group isn't a valid Python identifier (e.g. because it starts with a number)
* Improved performance in certain complex node trees. In one particular testscene, previews were only slowly
  showing up after 5 minutes of waiting - now they start appearing instantly and all previews for the tree are
  completed in a few seconds

v1.10:
* Prevented problems when a material and a world have the same name and contain nodes with the same name
* Fixed preview thumbnails flickering in Blender 3.1 in the time between detaching a node wire and letting go of it
  (the node socket reports that it is still linked, while not actually being linked anymore, which might be a bug in Blender)
* Added support for OSL script nodes
* Fixed potential name collision problems when linking an image that has the same name as an existing image
  (e.g. there's a "stone.png" image in the .blend, and a different "stone.png" is linked in from another .blend)
* Fixed bug triggered by unconnected reroute nodes in node groups
* Added a workaround for a Blender bug (T97027/T97259) that made a diagonal line appear in the thumbnails in some cases

v1.9:
* Added support for Python 3.10 on macOS (including on M1 CPUs)
* Added a shortcut for choosing the active output of a node manually. Before, the addon always used the first
  connected output automatically. This is still the default behaviour, but now the user can also select a node,
  press Shift+O, and choose any other output to be shown in the preview thumbnail.

v1.8:
* Added support for Python 3.10 on Windows and Linux

v1.7:
* Added support for the Apple Silicon (M1) version of Blender

v1.6:
* Fixed previews not working after opening a .blend file directly (by double-clicking it in the OS file explorer)
  (this was a regression introduced in v1.5)
* Fixed some shader node previews not working in Blender 3.0

v1.5:
* Fixed background process stopping when an image file did not exist at the specified path
* New packed images are now automatically loaded as soon as possible (when the .blend file is saved)
* Improved the error messages shown when an image file doesn't exist or could not be linked
* Fixed images not being reloaded if the path of an existing image datablock was modified
* If a packed file can't be linked, but exists on disk, it is now loaded from disk as fallback
* The debug log output can now be enabled in the user preferences (can be useful when making a bug report)
* Fixed old rendering jobs still being processed after loading a new .blend file (was a problem when opening
  a file with hundreds of nodes, then switching to another file before all thumbnails were rendered. Outdated jobs are now discarded)

v1.4:
* Added support for Blender 2.93
* Fixed fallback for unsupported image formats not working and returning a black image
* Fixed addon not working if an alternative scripts path was set, but the addon was installed in the default location

v1.3:
* Improved performance in complex node trees. In a scene with 295 nodes, the update checks took
  around 200 milliseconds before, which resulted in 5 frames per second in the node editor.
  Now, they only take around 40 milliseconds (25 frames per second)
* Fix UV Map output being black when using a UV map that doesn't exist on the preview mesh
* New shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+P toggles the node preview thumbnail of selected nodes on/off
* It is now possible to choose in the user preferences wether previews should be visible by default.
  You can set this to disabled if you only want a few nodes to show previews (use Ctrl+Shift+P to enable them)
* New controls in the N-Panel of the node editor (right side), with options to disable/enable
  previews for the whole node tree or selected nodes.

v1.2:
* Added support for macOS
* Fixed frames in node groups causing all thumbnails for the current node tree to disappear
* Fixed unsupported nodes causing all previews to disappear
* Added support for custom nodes which are internally node groups, e.g. FxNodes

v1.1:
* Enabled previews on the Geometry node
* Fixed addon not working if installed in an alternative scripts path (Preferences > File Paths > Data > Scripts)
* Users can now pick custom colors for the background which is shown behind transparent shaders
