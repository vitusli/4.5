## What is 3DN BIP?

_3DN BIP_ or _3D Ninjas Blender Image Preview_ is a library, which allows blazingly fast preview image loads in Blender. Furthermore, it can load preview images of arbitrary size. It operates as an `bpy.utils.previews` drop-in replacement and does all the heavy lifting for you.

Our library enables the following major use cases:

1. Load preview images shipped as BIP images blazingly fast. We recommend this approach in case you can generate the images beforehand. In this case, your users don't need to take any action to enjoy the speed boost.
2. Load regular JPEG or PNG preview images blazingly fast. Recommended in case you need to load images provided by the user or by external software tools. For that, we need [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) on the user's system. It would be best if you use our prepared `InstallPillow` operator so that your users can enjoy the speed boost with a simple click.

Notes:

1. Our library will always fall back to `bpy.utils.previews` if unsupported formats are to be loaded. For this reason, there is absolutely no disadvantage in using this library. In the worst case, we will apply the standard mechanism of Blender.
2. `.bip` is a highly optimized image format, which can be transferred to Blender's internal data structures immediately. It is always blazingly fast, whether [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) is installed or not.
