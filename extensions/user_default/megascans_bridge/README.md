# Megascans Bridge - Blender Add-on

Megascans Bridge is a Blender add-on that imports Quixel Megascans assets downloaded via [Quixel Bridge](https://quixel.com/bridge) directly from the Blender interface. The downloaded assets will be sorted by type, category and subcategory.

## Workflow

- Download [Quixel Bridge](https://quixel.com/bridge) and download the Megascans assets through it.

- Once you download the Megascans assets, they will be saved in the default path `/Documents/Megascans Library/Downloaded/`

- Add the path in the add-on preferences under the `Library` tab.

- After adding the path, the assets will appear in the `Sidebar(n-panel)` under the `M-Bridge` tab.

- Now you can import the assets directly from the Blender interface.
