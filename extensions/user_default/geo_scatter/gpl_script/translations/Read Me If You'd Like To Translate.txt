
Hello,
First of all, thank you for doing the translation—your effort is greatly appreciated!
Please don’t hesitate to contact us so we can include your translation in our plugin.

When translating the data within the .csv files, there are a few rules to follow:
1) The translation format must always be a ".csv" file. For each row:
 - The first column contains the original text. (It is important that this column is not altered or changed in any way.)
 - The second column should contain the translation.
 - The third column provides information on where the original text is located within our plugin code.
2) Symbols like '\n' are important, as they indicate a new line. Please do not erase them. If you want to insert a new line, use the '\n' symbol if it already exists in the original translation.
3) Please try to respect the text length. If the text is short, it may have been designed to fit small spaces in the plugin GUI.
4) Do not format any of the cells (no colors or text styles), as this may cause bugs. Work with plain text only.
5) Please respect Blender's canonical terms, such as "Vertex-Group" or "UV-Map" in your language. If Blender has already translated "Vertex-Group" with a specific term, please stick to the official translation.
6) Once finished, please do a quick overview of Geo-Scatter interface and operators, sees if the translations are well fit in the GUI and are contextually correct.

Pro Tip:
Copy the entire first column, create a temporary website on https://ctxt.io/, 
and then use Google Translate to translate the webpage (https://translate.google.com). 
This is a good way to avoid starting the translation from scratch.
